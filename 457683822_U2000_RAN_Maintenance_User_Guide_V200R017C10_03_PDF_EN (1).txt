Organization 

                     1 RAN Maintenance Panorama 

                     The RAN maintenance panorama enables you to obtain a whole picture of the functions for 
                     each RAT during initial deployment and routine maintenance phases. 

                     2 Antenna Management 

                     This section describes how to manage the antenna system through the U2000. Antenna 
                     management involves antenna system monitoring, fault detection, and fault rectification. 

                     3 Centralized RAN Network Monitoring 

                     The U2000 provides central monitoring and maintenance of the RNCs/BSCs, NodeBs/BTSs, 
                     and cells on the WRAN and GBSS networks. This function enables you to classify required 
                     objects into a monitoring group and then monitor the alarm statuses, disconnection statuses, 
                     KPI statuses, and cell statuses of devices in real time. This function also enables you to 
                     quickly identify exceptions and maintain devices. The U2000 can also query and adjust 
                     configuration data. 

                     4 Multimode Base Station Management 

                     A multimode base station supports multiple RATs, and can work in dual or triple modes. A 
                     multimode base station can also work in co-MPT or separate-MPT mode, depending on the 
                     RAT deployment on the main control board. 

                     5 GU DSS Management 

                     Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) dynamically reuseg some GSM spectrum resources 
                     between the GSM and UMTS networks based on the feature that the busy hours of GSM 
                     voice services and UMTS data services are different. This increases spectrum utilization and 
                     reduces costs of data services. With the GU DSS management feature, the U2000 can share 
                     spectrums or reclaim shared spectrums by setting related parameters. 

                     6 NE License Management 

                     A license governs the usage and redistribution of a product, such as the product function, 
                     applicable territory, and validity period. It is granted by Huawei to an operator as an element 
                     of an agreement between them, giving the operator permission to use certain functions 
                     provided by the product within a specified territory and validity period. An operator can 
                     flexibly select network functions and capacity applicable to a certain stage by purchasing 
                     related licenses, thereby minimizing investment. The U2000 provides NE license 
                     management functions, such as uploading, activation, and allocation. 

                     7 Network Optimization Data Collection 

                     You can collect the data required for network planning and optimization through the U2000. 
                     The neighboring cell optimization data, uplink frequency data, and MR data collected through 
                     the U2000 are stored in a specified directory on the U2000 server. Network log data is stored 
                     in the corresponding directory on a specified third-party server. The four types of data are 
                     used by network engineers to plan and optimize networks through the Nastar. 

                     8 NodeB OM Data Migration 

                     To re-parent NodeBs, the RNC sends a command about deleting NodeBs and then a command 
                     about creating NodeBs to the U2000. Upon receiving the command of NodeB deletion, the 
                     U2000 closes the connection with the physical NodeBs rather than directly deleting the

                    NodeBs. In this way, you can determine the binding relation between the NodeBs before and 
                     after the re-parenting, thus avoiding the loss of alarm and performance data. 

                     9 RNC Pool Maintenance 

                     This section describes how to maintain RNC pools on the U2000 client. The RNC pool is a 
                     disaster-proof solution in which NodeBs are connected to two RNCs. When the RNC 
                     currently managing NodeBs is faulty, the NodeBs are automatically switched over to the other 
                     RNC in the pool to avoid network failure and ensure service provision. 

                     10 BSC Pool Maintenance 

                     The BSC Pool is a disaster tolerance mechanism that is implemented by configuring two 
                     BSCs for one BTS to prevent system breakdown caused by BSC faults. This section describes 
                    the methods of managing the BSC Pool on the U2000 client. 

                     11 RNC in Pool View Management 

                     RNC in Pool is a mechanism for load sharing and node redundancy between RNCs. In the 
                     RNC in Pool view, you can learn the mapping between logical RNCs and physical RNCs 
                     (master RNCs and backup/overflow RNCs) in a pool, and the enabling status of load sharing 
                     and node redundancy functions. 

                     12 Cloud BB View Management 

                     The Cloud BB includes a cluster of base stations associated by the switch. The Cloud BB 
                     allows inter-base station service collaboration. The Cloud BB view allows users to view and 
                    maintain NEs in the Cloud BB. 

                     13 Viewing the SRC View 

                     The SRC (Single Radio Controller) view allows users to manage host NEs and Built-in NEs. 
                     Host NEs manage devices and resources and open resources to Built-in NEs, whereas Built-in 
                    NEs use devices and resources of host NEs to implement specific network function. The SRC 
                    view on the U2000 allows users to view host and Built-in NEs. 

                     14 DHCP Configuration Management 

                     To help NEs automatically obtain IP addresses by using the DHCP service, the U2000 
                    provides the DHCP configuration management function. This function helps users query and 
                    maintain the DHCP information about each NE and view the DHCP process of each NE 
                    through the graphical user interface (GUI). 

                     15 CBTS Reparenting 

                     The U2000 supports reparenting of CBTSs, GBTSs, NodeBs, and multimode base stations. 
                     This section describes how to reparent CBTSs under one CBSC or between two CBSCs 
                     during network operation. For details about how to reparent GBTSs, NodeBs, and multimode 
                    base stations, see Reparenting Base Stations in CME Product Documentation. 

                     16 AP Information Management 

                     The AP (Access Point) converts cable signals to radio signals and allows terminal devices to 
                     access wireless LANs. The U2000 allows users to modify and plan location information and 
                     alias of APs by exporting an importing configuration file.

                       ACs (Access Controller) that manage APs can be deployed in active/standby mode. The AC 
                       Hot Backup View is used to manage the active and standby ACs. The AC Hot Backup View 
                       vie on the U2000 allows users to view the active and standby ACs. 

                       18 Viewing the Virtual Platform View 

                       The virtual platform view is used to display relationships between physical platform NEs and 
                       virtual NEs in the CloudEdge, WLAN, and SVA solutions. 

                       19 Maintaining NE Groups 

                       The base station group view helps you view and set base station groups. The U2000 allows 
                       you to query base station alarms by base station group. 

                       20 Monitoring Channel Status 

                       This section describes how to monitor the status of all channels and subchannels of eGBTS 
                       TRXs so that users can view their availability. 

                       21 Multioperator Network Management 

                       The RAN sharing feature enables multiple telecom operators to share radio access network 
                       (RAN) devices. The multioperator core network (MOCN) feature enables multiple telecom 
                       operators to share cells. To support the two features, the U2000 provides functions, such as 
                       multioperator parameter setting, northbound interface (NBI) management. For details about 
                       the principle for RAN sharing and the guide for data configuration, see MOCN Feature 
                       Parameter Description and RAN Sharing Feature Parameter Description released along

                       This section describes how to detect transmission faults of the small-cell base station when 
                       the OM link of the small-cell base station is faulty or the cells are out of service. Users can 
                       query the information about the peer transmission device corresponding to the small-cell base 
                       station on the U2000, and detect and locate the peer transmission device faults on the U2000 
                       where the MBB backhaul management component is installed. Through checking last-mile 
                       transmission devices, users can quickly locate the faulty node, reducing the manual 
                       maintenance workload at the local end of the small-cell base station. 

                       23 Managing Location Information About a LampSite Base Station 

                       The function of managing location information about a LampSite base station allows you to 
                       view the indoor location of LampSite devices on the U2000 client based on the indoor map 
                       and browse alarms reported by faulty devices, improving LampSite device fault recovery 
                       efficiency and reducing daily maintenance costs. 

                       24 Managing Location Information About a Pico Base Station 

                       After a pico base station is deployed, you can import a pico location information engineering 
                       file to the U2000 server to save it. If the pico base station is faulty, you can export its fault 
                       information and location information engineering file for maintenance personnel to locate the 
                       fault.

                     2.2 Antenna Fault Detection 
                     This section describes how to remotely detect antenna faults on the GBSS network through 
                     the U2000 in a centralized manner. The detection enables you to locate the faulty site and take 
                     measures to rectify the faults during site maintenance. Compared with traditional 
                     troubleshooting methods, the antenna fault detection function can significantly reduce site 
                     maintenance costs. 

                     2.3 Interference Detection 
                     This section describes the interference detection feature, which is used by the U2000 to detect 
                     interference on base stations and boards. This section also describes how to start a detection 
                     process. 

                     2.4 VSWR Check for a Base Station 
                     This section describes the operations and GUIs for checking the VSWR of a base station. 
                     Currently, this feature is only not available to UMTS BTS3803E. The TD-NodeB supports 
                     only single-frequency VSWR check. 

                     2.5 Cross Feeder Connection Detection 
                     This section describes how to check for cross feeder connections on base stations using the 
                     U2000 client. Performing cross feeder connection detection affects NE services. Therefore, 
                     you are advised to perform the detection during site deployment or troubleshooting.

2.1 ALD Management 

                      This section describes how to use the ALD management function provided by the U2000 to 
                      remotely manage ALDs collectively during network commissioning, operation, and 
                      maintenance. The management function helps you ensure that the ALDs work properly. 

2.1.1 Overview of ALD Management 

                      During the commissioning phase of a new site, you can configure the ALDs for base stations 
                      on the U2000 to ensure that the ALDs can work properly. During network maintenance, you 
                      can adjust the ALDs on the U2000 accordingly if the cell range or TMA gain needs to be 
                      changed according to the actual operation of the existing network. Using the ALD 
                      management function provided by the U2000, you can remotely and centrally manage the 
                      ALDs of a site, reducing OM costs.

                           If an ALD is faulty, the ALD reports an alarm to the U2000. You can view the ALD 
                           alarms related to base stations by using the antenna management function, and know the 
                           ALD faults that occur on all the base stations on the entire network. 

                      l    Software management 

                           The U2000 provides the software loading function if an ALD is faulty or needs to be 
                           upgraded. 

                      l    RAE engineering parameter query 

                           You can query RAE engineering parameters to learn the ALD posture and location.

                      data, log data, and alarm data of an ALD in real time. 

Context 

                      The data used by the AMS is obtained from the U2000 server. You can choose either of the 
                      following methods to manually synchronize ALD information: 

                      l     Manually synchronizing ALD information from NEs 

                            If you synchronize ALD information from NEs, the U2000 server queries ALD 
                            information from NEs and requests the AMS browser to update the query results. 

                      l     Manually synchronizing ALD information from the U2000 server 

                            If you synchronize ALD information from the U2000 server, the AMS browser queries 
                            ALD information from the U2000 server. 

Procedure 

                      l     To manually synchronize ALD information from NEs, perform the following steps: 

                            a.   Click the Device tab in the Configuration window. 

                            b.   From the NE navigation tree on the left, select the NodeB or RNC to be 
                                 synchronized. 
                                 If you select an RNC, the system synchronizes all the NodeBs managed by this 
                                 RNC.

2.1.4 (Optional) Obtaining Basic Information About Reused 
TMAs After Replacement 

                      This section describes how to obtain basic information about reused TMAs using the TMA 
                      identification function after base stations are replaced. 

Prerequisites 

                      l     The U2000 can communicate with TMAs through base stations after base stations are 
                            replaced. 

                      l     The TMAs to be identified must be manufactured by Huawei because only Huawei 
                            TMAs can be identified. 

Context 

                      During base station replacement (non-Huawei base stations and Huawei TMAs before 
                      replacement and Huawei base stations and Huawei TMAs after replacement), TMAs are 
                      reused. After base station replacement, engineers need to obtain basic TMA information for 
                      TMA data configuration. 

                      However, before base station replacement, because the TMA communicates with the U2000 
                      through the RRU module in the base station, the U2000 cannot manage base stations of 
                      another vendor, and engineers cannot obtain TMA information using the U2000. Therefore, 
                      the U2000 provides the TMA identification function to obtain basic TMA information so that 
                      engineers can perform subsequent configuration. 

                      The TMA identification function support the following functions: 

                      l     Obtains basic information about common and smart TMAs. The identification result 
                            report can be exported in .xls format. 

                            Only Huawei TMAs can be identified. 

                            The identification result report contains NE Name, Cabinet No., Subrack No., Slot No., 
                            Antenna Port No., Sector ID, Sector Name, Cell ID, Cell Name, Power Switch, TMA 
                            Configuration Switch(GSM), TMA Attenuation Factor(GSM), Receive Channel

2.1.5 Automatic ALD Deployment 

                    This section describes how to automatically deploy the antenna line device (ALD). 

2.1.5.1 Automatic ALD Deployment Process 

                    This section describes the automatic antenna line device (ALD) deployment process. The 
                    automatic ALD deployment function provided by the U2000 completes the configuration and 
                    maintenance for ALDs without requiring manual intervention. This reduces complexity of 
                    manual ALD configuration during initial site deployment, swapping, and maintenance. 
                    Automatic ALD deployment applies to base stations in the version of SRAN9.0 and later. 

                    Before automatic ALD deployment, the following preparations must be completed: 

                    l    The hardware installation of base stations is complete. 

                    l    You have obtained the RET configuration file from the vendor of the ALD. 

                    Automatic ALD Deployment Process 

                    ALD deployment involves the following operations: 

                    1.   Turn on the antenna power supply switch. 

                    2.   Scan ALDs. 

                    3.   Add an ALD. 

                    4.   Set default parameter values for subunits of the ALD. 

                    5.   Load the RET configuration file. 

                    6.   Calibrate the RET. 

                    7.   Set the RET downtilt angle. 

                    8.   Set other parameters such as channel attenuation. 

                    Figure 2-2 shows the automatic ALD deployment process. Table 2-1 describes the process. 
                    After performing step 1 through step 3 of the automatic ALD deployment process, all 
                    operations required in the manual ALD deployment process (substep 1 through substep 8) are 
                    completed.

2.1.5.2 Starting an Automatic ALD Deployment Task 

                      Users need to start an automatic ALD deployment task when configuring the ALD in 
                      automatic mode. 

Context 

                      l     Automatic ALD deployment applies to base stations in the version of SRAN9.0 or later. 

                      l     The automatic ALD deployment task resets the antenna power supply switch, affecting 
                            services. Start an automatic ALD deployment task with caution. 

                      l     Each selected NE is assigned an automatic ALD deployment task. Only one automatic 
                            ALD deployment task can be created for the same NE. 

                      l     Users in the non-Administrators groups can only manage tasks created by themselves. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Click the ALD Auto Deployment tab on the antenna device management main window. 

             Step 2   Start an automatic ALD deployment task.

2.1.5.3 Configuring the RET in Batches 

                      Configuring the RET in batches is the second step in the automatic ALD deployment process. 
                      When configuring the RET in batches, users need to upload the RET configuration file to the 
                      OSS server, export the RET configuration template, fill in the template, and import the edited 
                      template. After the preceding operations are performed, the RET configuration file is loaded, 
                      the RET is calibrated, and the RET downtilt angle is set. Configuring the RET in batches 
                      simplifies operations and reduces manual workload. 

Prerequisites 

                       l    You have obtained the RET configuration file from the vendor of the ALD. 

                       l    You have started an automatic ALD deployment task, and the task is in the to-be- 
                            acknowledged state. For detailed operations, see 2.1.5.2 Starting an Automatic ALD 
                            Deployment Task.

2.1.6 Manual ALD Configurations 

                       This section describes how to set the attributes of an antenna line device (ALD), including the 
                       attributes of the remote electrical tilt (RET), tower mounted amplifier (TMA), and same-band 
                       antenna sharing unit (SASU). 

2.1.6.1 Setting the Power Supply Status of an ALD 

                       This section describes how to set the power supply status of an ALD. You need to set the 
                       power supply switch to ON and set the ALD current alarm threshold for an ALD to ensure its 
                       proper operation. 

Prerequisites 

                       The MAFU or RRU corresponding to the antenna port is running properly. 

Context 

                       After the ALD current alarm threshold is set, the NodeB reports a corresponding alarm in 
                       time when the current equals to or exceeds the lower current threshold. When the current 
                       exceeds the upper current threshold, the NodeB reports an alarm and determines whether to 
                       set the power supply switch of the ALD to OFF based on preset parameters. 

                       After the power supply switch is set to OFF, the RRU checks whether the current is recovered 
                       on schedule. If the current is restored within the check period, the RRU automatically sets the 
                       power supply switch to ON. If the current is not restored within the check period, you can 
                       manually set the ALD power supply switch to ON after rectifying the fault. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Set the power supply switch of an ALD to ON and set the ALD current alarm threshold. 

                       1.   Click the Power Switch tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device 
                            management main window. 

                       2.   From the NE navigation tree in the left pane, select the NodeB or GBTS where the ALD 
                            to be set is located. 

                            The power supply information about all the ALDs of the selected NE is displayed in a 
                            list in the right pane.

2.1.6.2 Scanning an ALD 

                      This section describes how to scan an ALD to obtain the parameters of the ALD, such as the 
                      ALD type, protocol version, vendor code, and ALD SN when you forget to record the ALD 
                       SN or the recorded SN is wrong. 

Prerequisites 

                      Before scanning an ALD, ensure that the power supply switch of the ALD is set to ON. 
                      Otherwise, the corresponding object cannot be scanned. For details about how to set the 
                      power supply switch of an ALD to ON, see 2.1.6.1 Setting the Power Supply Status of an 
                      ALD. 

Context 

                      A scanned ALD is a device physically connected to a base station, which is irrespective of 
                      whether data configuration of the ALD is complete.

                         NOTE 

                           It takes a long time to scan an ALD, which may exceed one minute. Therefore, scanning is not 
                           recommended unless otherwise specified. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Click the Device tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device management main 
                      window. 

            Step 2    In the NE navigation tree, select the base station whose ALDs need to be scanned. 

                         NOTE 

                           Click                                            and choose By NE Name or By IP Address, and 
                           then enter part of an NE name as the keyword in the search box. The NE tree automatically searches out 
                           NEs containing the keyword. 

            Step 3    Click Scan, and then click OK in the displayed dialog box. 

                      You can view the scanning status in the Scan devices dialog box. 

                         NOTE 

                           If the scanning status information contains the message The scanning failed. Run this 
                           command on a single RF module to locate the fault., the ALDs may be used by 
                           other tasks. You are advised to scan the ALDs in 15 minutes. 

            Step 4    After the scanning is complete, click Confirm. 

                      The scanning results are displayed in Scan ALD List. 

                      ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                      After modifying the scanning data, you can add the ALD data to the base station data by 
                      referring to Adding an ALD. 

2.1.6.3 Adding an ALD 

                      This section describes how to configure the data of an antenna line device (ALD) after 
                      installing the ALD. This ensures that the ALD works properly in the commissioning phase 
                      and prepares for future management and maintenance of the ALD. 

Prerequisites 

                      An ALD is installed. 

Context 

                      You can quickly add ALD data in batches by importing the ALD file. For details about how to 
                      import ALD data, see 2.1.6.4 Adding ALDs in Batches. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Click the Device tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device management main 
                      window.

             Step 2    In the navigation tree in the left pane, select the base station to which an ALD is to be added, 
                       and then click the Scan ALD List tab. 

                           NOTE 

                            Click                                              and choose By NE Name or By IP Address, and 
                            then enter part of an NE name as the keyword in the search box. The NE tree automatically searches out 
                            NEs containing the keyword. 

             Step 3    Click Add Manually. In the displayed dialog box, add the ALD information. 

                       If you need to add multiple lines of information, repeat the previous step. 

                       l     The name of an ALD is used to identify the ALD. The following naming convention is 
                             recommended: site_sector + port + RF subsector + ALD type_network type. 

                       l     An ALD is used in the following scenarios: 

                              –   Regular installation 

                                  Each ANT_Tx/RxA port is installed with only one bipolar RET. The port also 
                                  controls the RET. 

                              –    Sector splitting 

                                  A maximum of six RETs can be installed on one ANT_Tx/RxA port through a 
                                  divider. The port controls all the RETs. 

                              –   ALD cascading 

                                  A maximum of six RETs installed on different ports is connected to one 
                                  ANT_Tx/RxA port through cascaded signal cables. The ANT_Tx/RxA port 
                                  controls all the RETs. 

                              –   2G extension 

                                  A NodeB controls the RETs installed on a BTS, which is an extended mode of 
                                  cascaded ALDs. 

                             When you add an ALD in the regular installation scenario, the system automatically 
                             scans the ALD to obtain its vendor code and serial number (SN). In other application 
                             scenarios, however, you must type the vendor code and SN of an ALD. Otherwise, the 
                             system fails to communicate with the ALD properly. You must type both the vendor code 
                             and the SN of an ALD. If either is available, the system regards it as invalid. If the 
                             vendor code and SN of an ALD are missing, you can query them by referring to 2.1.6.2 
                             Scanning an ALD. 

                       l     You can select the subunit ID of an ALD based on the ALD type. 

                              –   The ID of the AISG1.1 STMA subunit must be 0. 

                              –   The IDs of the AISG2.0 STMA and SASU subunits are 1 and 2, respectively. 

                              –   The IDs of six subunits supported by a multipole ALD can be 1 to 6 in sequence. 
                                  Otherwise, the IDs of subunits can only be 1 to 2. 

                              –   A monopole ALD has no subunit, and therefore the subunit ID is 0 by default. 

                           NOTE 

                            l   You can select one or multiple lines of information, click Copy, and then click Paste to copy the 
                                information to the table. 

                            l   You can select one or more lines of information and then click Remove to delete the information. 

             Step 4    Click Apply to complete the setting.

                      file of an RET contains some ALD parameter information, such as ALD calibration and 
                      downtilt angle setting. This helps you set up the mapping between a drive system and the 
                      downtilt angle of an ALD. For a new site, you need to download the configuration file of an 
                      RET to ensure that the RET can be properly configured.

Prerequisites 

                       l    An ALD is added. 

                       l    You have obtained the configuration file of an RET from the ALD vendor. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Click the RET Subunit tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device management 
                       main window. 

             Step 2    In the NE navigation tree in the left pane, select the base station where the RET is located. 

                           NOTE 

                            Click                                              and choose By NE Name or By IP Address, and 
                            then enter part of an NE name as the keyword in the search box. The NE tree automatically searches out 
                            NEs containing the keyword. 

             Step 3    On the device list in the right pane, select the RET whose configuration file is to be applied. 

             Step 4    Choose CFG File > Transfer from OSS Client to NE to select the RET configuration file 
                       saved on the local PC. Then, click OK to upload the selected file to the U2000 server. 

                       You can click Refresh to update the status information about the configuration file during file 
                       transfer. 

                           NOTE 

                            The Refresh operation will cause loss of unsaved configuration data. Before clicking Refresh, save 
                            configuration data first. 

                       After the file upload is complete, the base station obtains the configuration file from the 
                       U2000 server and then applies the file. The RET configuration file takes effect immediately 
                       after it is downloaded.

2.1.6.6 Calibrating an RET 

                       This section describes how to calibrate the location and control the precision of an ALD 
                       according to the configuration file and physical capability of the RET by calibrating an RET. 
                       This helps you ensure that all the downtilt angles supported by the RET are correctly set. 
                       After installing an RET, you must calibrate it. Otherwise, the downtilt angle of the RET may 
                       be incorrect, which affects network coverage. 

Prerequisites 

                       The configuration file of an RET is downloaded. 

Context 

                       l    You must calibrate all the RETs of a base station. Calibrating an RET, which affects 
                            ALD services, takes two to four minutes. 

                       l    You must calibrate all newly installed RETs. If a base station does not report any 
                             calibration alarm during routine maintenance, you also need to calibrate RETs and reset 
                            their downtilt angles. Generally, you need not recalibrate the RET after resetting or 
                            powering off the RET.

Prerequisites 

                      An RET is calibrated. 

Context 

                      It takes about two minutes to set the downtilt angle of an RET. After setting the downtilt 
                      angle, you can check the setting by synchronizing ALD information. For details about how to 
                      synchronize ALD information, see 2.1.3 Synchronizing ALD Information. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Click the RET Subunit tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device management 
                      main window. 

             Step 2   In the NE navigation tree in the left pane, select the base station where the RETs whose 
                      downtilt angles need to be set are located. 

                          NOTE 

                           Click                                             and choose By NE Name or By IP Address, and 
                           then enter part of an NE name as the keyword in the search box. The NE tree automatically searches out 
                           NEs containing the keyword. 

             Step 3   On the device list on the RET Subunit tab page, select one or more RETs whose downtilt 
                      angles need to be set. 

                      The parameters related to the RETs are displayed on the Detailed Info tab page. 

                                 NOTICE 

                      The downtilt angle ranges of RETs vary according to vendors and types. Therefore, before 
                      setting the downtilt angle of an RET, you need to check the maximum downtilt angle and 
                      minimum downtilt angle of the RET, and then set the downtilt angle within the valid range. 
                      Otherwise, the setting fails. 

             Step 4   On the Detailed Info tab page, click the parameter configuration cell, and then set the 
                      downtilt angles of the RETs. 

                                 NOTICE 

                      For monopole RETs, you need to set the downtilt angles of the two monopole RETs installed 
                      on the ANT_Tx/RxA and ANT_RxB ports to the same value. 

             Step 5   Click Apply for the setting to take effect. 

                      Do not close the current window. 4 minutes later, the U2000 queries the downtilt angles of the 
                      RETs from base stations and displays the query results. Then, you can determine whether the 
                      setting takes effect based on the query results.

Example 

                          NOTE 

                           A configuration example is provided for reference. If the parameter names displayed in the window are 
                           inconsistent with those in the example because of version difference between base stations, you need to 
                           refer to the parameter names displayed in the window. 

                      To set the downtilt angle of an RET that is installed on eNodeB001 named 
                      0_0R0A0RET_3G to two degrees, perform the following steps: 

                       1.   In the navigation tree in the left pane of RET Subunit, select eNodeB001. 

                      2.    On the device list in the right pane, select the RET whose Device Name is 
                            0_0R0A0RET_3G. 

                       3.   In the upper part of Detailed Info, check whether Minimum Tilt and Maximum Tilt 
                            are 0 and 100, respectively. The downtilt angle must be in this range. Then, set 
                            Tilt(0.1degree) to 20. 

                      4.    Click Apply. 

2.1.6.8 Configuring the TMA 

                      A TMA is a low-noise amplification module that can be installed on a tower. By adjusting the 
                      TMA, you can amplify uplink signals and balance uplink and downlink signals. After the 
                      ALD is installed, you can set the TMA attributes to enable the ALD to work normally. When 
                      commissioning base stations during site deployment or adjusting gains in daily maintenance, 
                      you need to set the TMA attributes. TMA attributes include the working mode and gain of the 
                      TMA. 

Prerequisites 

                      The TMA is installed on the base station and is connected to the base station normally. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Click the TMA Subunit tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device

                       2.    Query the gain range of the TMA. 

                             The gain ranges supported by TMAs vary according to vendors and types. Therefore, 
                             before setting the gain of a TMA, you need to check the maximum and minimum gains 
                             supported by the TMA, and then set the gain within the valid range. Otherwise, the 
                             settings fail. 

                       3.    Set the gain of the TMA. 

                             You can set the gain of the TMA to improve the receiver sensitivity of the base station 
                             and the uplink coverage and reduce the transmit power of user terminals. 

             Step 4    Click Apply for the setting to take effect. 

                       Do not close the current window. 4 minutes later, the U2000 queries the downtilt angles of the 
                       RETs from base stations and displays the query results. Then, you can determine whether the 
                       setting takes effect based on the query results. 

             Step 5    Optional: Click Query. Wait until the query task in the displayed dialog box is completed. 
                       Click Confirm and check the setting results on the Detailed Info tab page.

                           NOTE 

                            A configuration example is provided for reference. If the parameter names displayed in the window are 
                            inconsistent with those in the example because of version difference between base stations, you need to 
                            refer to the parameter names displayed in the window. 

                       Set the working mode of 0_0R0A0STMA_3G installed on eNodeB001 to Normal and set the 
                       gain to 12 dB. 

                       1.    Select eNodeB001 from the navigation tree on the left of TMA Subunit. 

                       2.    Select the TMA whose Device Name is 0_0R0A0STMA_3G from the device list on the 
                             right. 

                       3.    Set Work Mode to NORMAL in Detailed Info at the bottom. 

                       4.    View the values of Minimum Gain and Maximum Gain of the SASU. Both values are 
                             48. You need to set the gain within this range. Set Gain(0.25dB) to 48. 

                       5.    Click Apply. 

2.1.6.9 Configuring the SASU 

                       An SASU can combine two co-channel signals from different systems into one channel. In 
                       addition, it reduces insertion loss. Through an SASU, you can amplify uplink signals and 
                       manage an ALD that is shared by a BTS, a NodeB, and an eNodeB. After the ALD is 
                       installed, you can set the SASU attributes to enable the ALD to work normally. When 
                       commissioning base stations during site deployment or adjusting gains in daily maintenance, 
                       you need to set the SASU attributes. SASU attributes include the working mode, gain, DC 
                       power switch, and DC load. 

Prerequisites 

                       The SASU is installed on the base station and is connected normally to the base station.

Procedure 

             Step 1     Click the SASU Subunit tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device 
                       management main window.

                       navigation tree and then select the SASU to be configured from the device list on the SASU 
                        Subunit tab. 
                        The parameters related to the SASU are displayed on the Detailed Info tab. 

                           NOTE 

                             Click                                               and choose By NE Name or By IP Address, and 
                             then enter part of an NE name as the keyword in the search box. The NE tree automatically searches out 
                             NEs containing the keyword. 

             Step 3     Click the parameter cells to set the SASU attributes on the Detailed Info tab. 

                        1.    Set the working mode of the SASU. 
                             The SASU provides the function of amplifying signals only in its normal working mode. 

                        2.   Query the gain range of the SASU. 
                             The gain ranges supported by SASUs vary according to vendors and types. Therefore, 
                             before setting the gain of an SASU, you need to check the maximum and minimum gain 
                             supported by the SASU, and then set the gain within the valid range. Otherwise, the 
                             settings fail. 

                        3.   Set the gain of the SASU. 
                             You can set the gain of the SASU to improve the receiver sensitivity of the base station 
                             and the uplink coverage and reduce the transmit power of user terminals. 

                       4.    Set the antenna DC power switch of the SASU. 
                             When a BTS, a NodeB, and an eNodeB share one TMA, you need to set the antenna DC 
                             power switch of the SASU. The value range is as follows: BS, UMTS, and OFF. 

                                 NOTE 

                                  –   The antenna DC power switch can be set only on the main antenna port. If it is set on the 
                                      diversity antenna port, the message Not Supported is displayed. 

                                  –   This setting takes effect on both subunits of the SASU. 

                        5.   Set the DC load of the SASU. 

                             DC load is used to simulate the TMA in a GSM network. If you have set a high gain for 
                             a NodeB, the SASU needs to notify the GBTS that a TMA is connected to the ALD. In 
                             this case, the SASU generates DC load to the GBTS. By checking the DC load, the 
                             GBTS can detect that a TMA is connected to the ALD. 

                             If the antenna DC power switch is set to BS, the DC load of the BS is automatically 
                             adjusted to 0. 

             Step 4     Click Apply for the setting to take effect. 

                       Do not close the current window. 4 minutes later, the U2000 queries the downtilt angles of the 
                       RETs from base stations and displays the query results. Then, you can determine whether the 
                        setting takes effect based on the query results. 

             Step 5     Optional: Click Query. Wait until the query task in the displayed dialog box is completed.

2.1.10 Querying the Operation Logs of an ALD 

                       This section describes how to query the operation logs of an ALD. This enables you to 
                       monitor and analyze the running status of the ALD and to rectify faults on the ALD. 

Prerequisites 

                       The operation logs of an ALD are obtained from the U2000 database. Therefore, before 
                       obtaining these logs, you need to subscribe to and synchronize NE logs. 

                        1.   For details about how to subscribe to NE logs, see Subscribing to NE Logs. 

                       2.    For details about how to synchronize NE logs, see Synchronizing NE Logs. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Click the Log tab on the Configuration tab page in the antenna device management main 
                       window. 

             Step 2    Click Query, and then set query criteria. 

                       You can set criteria for filtering query results according to the actual requirement. This helps 
                       you focus on key information. The filtering criteria that you can set are as follows:

2.2 Antenna Fault Detection 

                     This section describes how to remotely detect antenna faults on the GBSS network through 
                     the U2000 in a centralized manner. The detection enables you to locate the faulty site and take 
                     measures to rectify the faults during site maintenance. Compared with traditional 
                     troubleshooting methods, the antenna fault detection function can significantly reduce site 
                     maintenance costs. 

2.2.1 Overview of Antenna Fault Detection 

                     This section describes the overview of the antenna fault detection function, fault detection 
                     range, and procedure of antenna fault detection. 

2.2.1.1 Antenna Fault Detection Function 

                     This section describes the antenna fault detection function. 

                     The antenna system transmits and receives signals on a communication network. Most 
                     antenna system faults are caused by hardware installation related to projects in network setup, 
                     reparenting, or optimization scenarios. Environment changes may also cause antenna system 
                     faults. These faults have adverse impacts on network quality. In addition, it is costly and time- 
                     consuming to rectify the faults. 

                     The U2000 can detect a faulty antenna using a fault detection algorithm. This facilitates site 
                     maintenance. Compared with traditional troubleshooting methods, the antenna fault detection 
                     function can significantly reduce site maintenance costs. 

Function Description 

                     Using the antenna fault detection function, you can remotely detect the antenna system on an 
                     entire network in a centralized manner. 

                     For the GBSS network, you can customize the detection sensitivity and export result reports 
                     through the U2000. 

                     l    Customizing the detection sensitivity 

                          During antenna fault detection, set thresholds of detection algorithms based on details 
                          about the networks where devices are located. In this way, the sensitivity of fault 
                          detection is improved. 

                     l    Exporting detection reports 

                          After a detection task is complete, export the antenna fault detection report to a local PC.

2.2.1.2 Antenna Fault Detection Principles 

                      This section describes the principles of detecting antenna faults on the GBSS network. 

                      The detection algorithms of the U2000 depend on NE performance data and detection 
                      algorithm thresholds. Figure 2-10 shows the impacts of the NE performance data and 
                      detection algorithm thresholds on detection algorithms. Table 2-8 lists the impacts. To obtain 
                      the result of an antenna fault detection task, use the thresholds preset for this detection and the 
                      performance data of NEs to be detected for calculation through the detection algorithm.

2.2.3 GBSS Antenna Fault Detection 

                       On the GBSS network, you can use the antenna fault detection function to detect antenna 
                       faults. This chapter provides the guide to using the antenna fault detection function, which 
                       helps you to detect faults. 

2.2.3.1 Importing Engineering Parameters 

                       Engineering parameters contain basic engineering information, such as the BTS type, BTS 
                       location information, and cell information. The detection of faults related to reversely 
                       connected cells depends on engineering parameters. Therefore, you need to import the 
                       engineering parameters before creating a task for detecting faults of the two types. 

Prerequisites 

                       l     The file contents of engineering parameters meet the actual requirements, and the 
                             content formats meet the U2000 requirements. For details about content format 
                            requirements, see 2.2.5.2 Engineering Parameters for Antenna Fault Detection. 

                       l     The U2000 server is running properly. 

                       l    NEs to be detected are connected properly to the U2000. 

                       l     The longitude and latitude values in the engineering parameters are accurate to four or 
                            more digits of decimals.

Context 

                     l    If some engineering parameters are not set or set incorrectly, the detection results of 
                          reversely connected cells are inaccurate. The U2000 deletes incomplete parameter 
                          settings after verifying the engineering parameters. 

                     l    You can export the template of engineering parameters from the U2000, modify the 
                          template, and then import it to the U2000 again. 

                     l    In the case of faults other than reversely connected cells, no engineering parameters are 
                          required. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   In the Fault Detector-GBSS main window, click Engineering Parameter. 

            Step 2   Click Import, and then import the prepared file of engineering parameters. 

                     If you need to import multiple files of engineering parameters, repeat this operation. For 
                     details about engineering parameters, see 2.2.5.2 Engineering Parameters for Antenna 
                     Fault Detection. 

                     1.   Click Browse, and then specify the save path of the file of engineering parameters on the 
                          local PC. 

                     2.   Click Confirm. The import is complete. 

                     ----End 

2.2.3.2 Creating an Antenna Fault Detection Task 

                     When creating an antenna fault detection task, you can specify NEs to be detected and fault 
                     detection items and set related parameters such as task execution time. When the execution 
                     conditions of the detection task are met, the system performs fault detection and analysis 
                     based on the preset parameters and certain algorithms and then generates a detection report. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    Before detecting the faults of reversely connected cells, you need to import engineering 
                          parameters required by the detection algorithms. In the case of other fault types, you 
                          need not import engineering parameters. 

                     l    The U2000 server is running properly. 

                     l    NEs to be detected are connected properly to the U2000. 

Context 

                     l    The execution time of an antenna fault detection task is determined by the following 
                          factors: number of detected NEs, preset fault detection items, and the amount of 
                          performance data. 

                     l    Antenna fault detection tasks can be executed only when the system has already 
                          collected sufficient performance data. For example, after you adjust an antenna system, 
                          an antenna fault detection task cannot be performed immediately to check whether the 
                          adjusted antenna system is functioning properly. Instead, you can start the task and 
                          obtain the adjustment result after the adjusted system has been running for a certain 
                          period such as one day.

Follow-up Procedure 

                       After a fault detection task is complete, you can view the fault detection report. 

2.2.3.3 Viewing an Antenna Fault Detection Report 

                       After an antenna fault detection task is complete, you can view the detection result of each 
                       detection item in the fault detection report to locate causes of the faults. 

Prerequisites 

                       l    The antenna fault detection task whose report you want to view is complete. 

                       l    The U2000 server is running properly. 

                       l    NEs to be detected are connected properly to the U2000. 

Context 

                       After an antenna fault task is manually or automatically performed, a fault detection report is 
                       generated. You can determine the execution progress of the corresponding antenna fault 
                       detection task based on the following information: 

                       l    Information in the Progress column of the fault detection list. 

                       l    Information in the Status column of the fault detection list. 

                       When Status of a task in the list of fault detection tasks is displayed as Finished, the fault 
                       detection task is complete and the corresponding fault detection report is generated. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Select a task whose detection report you need to query from the fault detection task list in the 
                       Fault Detector-GBSS main window. 

             Step 2    Click Export to save the fault detection report from the U2000 server to the U2000 client. 

                       In a fault detection report, a sheet is generated to save fault detection results of each detection 
                       item that is selected in a fault detection task.

2.2.4.1 How Do I Improve the Antenna Fault Detection Sensitivity? 

Question 

                      The faulty cells displayed in an antenna fault detection report are inconsistent with the actual 
                      cells. 

Answer 

                      Antenna fault detection indicates the possibility of faults. The detection procedure depends on 
                      NE performance data and detection thresholds. If the performance data analysis time is too 
                       short or if the detection thresholds are set improperly, the detection results may be inaccurate. 

             Step 1   Modify the time segment for performance data analysis. 

                       1.   In the antenna fault detection window, select the task to be modified. 

                      2.    Click             . 

                       3.   In the displayed dialog box, change the start time and end time in Time Range for Fault 
                            Detecting. 

                      4.    Optional: If the detection task is a one-time task, reconfigure the task execution time. 

                       5.   Click OK. 

                       6.   After performing the task again, view the detection report. If the report still contains 
                            incorrect information, change the detection thresholds by referring to Step 2. 

             Step 2   Change the detection thresholds. 

                       1.   In the antenna fault detection window, select the task to be modified. 

                      2.    Click             . 

                       3.   In the displayed dialog box, click Advanced Setting.... 

                      4.    Change the thresholds. 

                       5.   Click OK.

2.2.4.2 What Do I Do When the Internet Explorer Automatically Closes? 

Question 

                      After you click a button when using the antenna fault detection function, the Internet Explorer 
                      automatically closes. 

Answer 

                      The possible reason to the problem is that third-party OWSBrowserUI is installed. 
                      OWSBrowserUI may modify the function definition of the Internet Explorer. As a result, the 
                      Internet Explorer automatically closes after you click some buttons. You can perform the 
                      following steps to disable OWSBrowserUI and then open the antenna fault management web 
                      page again. 

             Step 1   On the toolbar of the Internet Explorer, choose Tools > Internet Options. The Internet 
                      Options dialog box is displayed.

2.2.4.3 How Do I Check the Progress of Antenna Connection Detection? 

Question 

                     How should I check whether the dialing test of a sector is complete during antenna connection 
                     detection? 

Answer 

                     If the status of the sector is displayed as Finished in the progress information in the Memo 
                     field of the NodeB list, the dialing data is collected. You need not perform dialing test again. 

                     {Site No.=0;Sector No.=0 : Finish}{Site No.=0;Sector No.=1 : 
                     110}{Site No.=0;Sector No.=2 : Finish} indicates the data of the sector Site 
                     No.=0;Sector No.=0 and the sector Site No.=0;Sector No.=2 is collected. You need not 
                     perform dialing test again in these two sectors. But for the sector Site No.=0, Sector No.=1, 
                     the data of the third sector Site No.=0, Sector No.=2 is missing (the third value is 0). You 
                     need to perform dialing test in the sector Site No.=0, Sector No.=1 again.

                       checking engineering parameters. 

                       If engineering parameters are unavailable or incorrect, the fault detection results that depend 
                       on engineering parameters are inaccurate. The U2000 deletes incomplete engineering 
                       parameters after verifying the engineering parameter settings. Figure 2-12 shows an example 
                       of engineering parameters used in GBSS network antenna fault detection. Table 2-9 lists the

2.3 Interference Detection 

                        This section describes the interference detection feature, which is used by the U2000 to detect 
                        interference on base stations and boards. This section also describes how to start a detection 
                        process. 

2.3.1 Overview of Interference Detection 

                        This section provides an overview of intermodulation interference detection. Performing RF 
                        fault detection over air interfaces requires high professional skills, and engineers need to 
                        perform certain operations onsite, such as detecting intermodulation interference and 
                        determining interference types. This leads to insufficiency and low efficiency of RF-related 
                        OM operations over air interfaces. The U2000 enables you to perform intermodulation 
                        interference detection on managed base stations or boards. In this way, faults can be located 
                        quickly and network OM efficiency is improved.

                        After receiving customer complaints, NE fault alarms, or KPI optimization requests, OM 
                        personnel perform interference detection on NEs using the U2000 to check whether signal 
                        interference exists. If any signal interference is detected, the U2000 performs preliminary 
                        fault handling or sends fault handling requests to related OM personnel based on the detection 
                        result. The U2000 performs only preliminary remote handling on faults, as shown in Figure 
                        2-14. 

                            NOTE 

                             Local handling and remote OM are defined in view of the base station (GBTS, NodeB, or eNodeB). If 
                             OM is performed onsite, it is called local handling. Otherwise, it is called remote handling.

2.3.3 Performing Interference Detection 

                       This section describes how to perform interference detection to locate faults on RF devices. 
                       Generally, interference detection is performed during device cutover or routine maintenance. 
                       You can perform interference detection on RF devices every few days or months depending 
                       on the application scenario. 

Prerequisites 

                       l    The RF devices to be detected have not generated major alarms. 

                       l    You are advised to perform interference detection during the hours of light traffic (such 
                            as in the early morning). 

Procedure 

                       l    Creating a manual execution task 

                            a.    In the U2000 main window, choose Maintenance > Antenna Management >

2.4 VSWR Check for a Base Station 

                       This section describes the operations and GUIs for checking the VSWR of a base station. 
                       Currently, this feature is only not available to UMTS BTS3803E. The TD-NodeB supports 
                       only single-frequency VSWR check. 

2.4.1 Checking the VSWR of a Base Station 

                       This section describes how to check the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of a base 
                       station. The VSWR, also referred to as standing wave ratio, is the standard used for checking 
                       whether the antenna system is installed correctly. The U2000 can check the VSWR of a base 
                       station remotely and centralizedly. This helps check whether the ALD is installed properly.

                     l    The VSWR check is classified into single-frequency VSWR check and multi-frequency 
                          VSWR check. 

                          –    Single-frequency VSWR check: checks the VSWR based on the center frequency or 
                               the frequency set by users. 

                          –    Multi-frequency VSWR check: concurrently checks VSWRs of multiple 
                               frequencies based on the frequencies set by users. 

                          The VSWRs of different frequencies may differ. Therefore, alarms may be reported for 
                          working frequencies instead of the center frequency when you perform the single- 
                          frequency VSWR check, resulting in inaccurate check results. 

                     l    Large VSWRs may shorten transmission distances of signals and cause damage to power 
                          amplifiers, affecting the communication network negatively. The normal value range of 
                          VSWR is 1 to 1.5. The U2000 provides the default threshold plan. You can set the 
                          threshold plan before VSWR check as required. 

                                    NOTICE 

                          Testing VSWR leads to interruption of base station services. Therefore, you need to 
                          perform this operation during non-busy hours or after base station services are 
                          segregated. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Check whether interference detection tasks are running in the Maintenance > Antenna 
                    Management > Interference Measurement (traditional style); alternatively, double-click 
                     Trace and Maintenance in Application Center and choose Maintenance > Antenna 
                    Management > Interference Measurement (application style) window. If yes, execute the 
                    VSWR check task after the running interference detection task is complete. 

                              NOTICE 

                    If interference detection tasks are running on base stations, the VSWR check result is empty. 
                    In such case, execute the VSWR check task after the running interference detection task is 
                     complete. 

            Step 2   Choose Maintenance > Antenna Management > VSWR Test (traditional style); 
                     alternatively, double-click Trace and Maintenance in Application Center and choose 
                    Maintenance > Antenna Management > VSWR Test (application style). The VSWR Test 
                    window is displayed. 

            Step 3   Set thresholds and their colors by NE type.

                       l    A base station is in the version of SRAN9.0 or later. 

Context 

                       Checking for cross feeder connections on the U2000 has the same effects as running the 
                       following MML commands: 

                       l    GBTS: STR BTSCROSFEEDTST 

                       l    NodeB, eNodeB, and co-MPT base station: STR CROSFEEDTST 

                       For more information, see MML command reference of the related NE. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    In the U2000 main window, choose Maintenance > Antenna Management > Cross Feeder 
                       Test (traditional style); alternatively, double-click Trace and Maintenance in Application 
                       Center and choose Maintenance > Antenna Management > Cross Feeder Test (application 
                       style). 

                                  NOTICE 

                       Cross feeder connection detection causes service interruption. In multi-mode RF modules, 
                       this function will cause interruption of peer service. Perform this operation with caution. 

             Step 2    Click Parameter Settings in the right pane of the Cross Feeder Test window. The window 
                       for setting parameters is displayed. 

             Step 3    Set NE Type based on the objects to be detected and set detection parameters. 

                       By default, you do not need to set detection parameters. In such a case, the default values are 
                       used. If you need to set detection parameters, set both of the parameters and ensure that the 
                       maximum detection frequency is greater than the minimum detection frequency. 

             Step 4    In the navigation tree of the Cross Feeder Test window, select a base station on which the 
                       detection is to be performed. 

                          NOTE 

                            You can select at most 60 base stations at a time. It requires 2 to 3 minutes for the detection results to 
                            return for each base station. 

             Step 5    Click Test, then click Yes in Warning window to start cross feeder connection detection. 

                       During the detection, you can click Stop to stop a detection task. The U2000 stops receiving 
                       data reported by the base station at this time. However, the detection task does not stop on the 
                       base station until the task is completed. 

                       The results are displayed in the Cross Feeder Test Result table. If cross feeder connections 
                       are detected, you can find the detailed information in the Actual Test Same Sector/Cell 
                       Antenna Info table. 

             Step 6    Optional: To save a detection result, select it and click Save. In the displayed dialog box, 
                       specify a path to save the result to the local PC.

About This Chapter 

                     The U2000 provides central monitoring and maintenance of the RNCs/BSCs, NodeBs/BTSs, 
                     and cells on the WRAN and GBSS networks. This function enables you to classify required 
                     objects into a monitoring group and then monitor the alarm statuses, disconnection statuses, 
                     KPI statuses, and cell statuses of devices in real time. This function also enables you to 
                     quickly identify exceptions and maintain devices. The U2000 can also query and adjust 
                     configuration data. 

                     3.1 Overview of Centralized RAN Network Monitoring 
                     This section describes concepts related to centralized RAN network monitoring, including 
                     monitoring groups, introduction to centralized network monitoring, configuration object 
                     models, and counters for monitoring a WRAN network. These basic concepts help you to 
                     perform operations related to centralized RAN network monitoring. 

                     3.2 Monitoring Groups Management 
                     This section describes how to manage monitoring groups. You can classify the objects related 
                     to a certain service into a group called a monitoring group, and then monitor these objects in 
                     real time together. In addition to creating a monitoring group as required, you can delete, 
                     modify, rename, suspend, or activate an existing monitoring group. 

                     3.3 Monitoring/Maintaining Objects 
                     This section describes how to monitor and maintain objects. After creating a monitoring 
                     group, you can centrally monitor the required objects. This helps you to learn the statuses of 
                     objects in real time and maintain the objects in time if an exception occurs. 

                     3.4 GUIs and Parameters for RAN Network Monitoring 
                     This section describes the GUIs and parameters for network monitoring, such as alarm 
                     monitoring, performance monitoring, RAN network monitoring, and OSS system monitoring. 

                     3.5 The centralized RAN network monitoring-supported NEs and functions 
                     This section describes the technical specifications of the centralized RAN network monitoring 
                     feature, including supported NEs and function specifications.

3.1 Overview of Centralized RAN Network Monitoring 

                     This section describes concepts related to centralized RAN network monitoring, including 
                     monitoring groups, introduction to centralized network monitoring, configuration object

                     perform operations related to centralized RAN network monitoring. 

3.1.1 Monitoring Groups 

                     This section describes monitoring groups. You can classify the objects related to a certain 
                     service into a monitoring group as required. In this way, you can concurrently monitor 
                     multiple objects and object statuses on the monitoring group panel. 

                     The U2000 supports the global monitoring group, NE monitoring group, and cell monitoring 
                     group. The group monitoring group is a special NE monitoring group. For details about the 
                     types of NEs and cells supported by the NE monitoring group and the cell monitoring group, 
                     see 3.5 The centralized RAN network monitoring-supported NEs and functions. 

                     l     Global monitoring group: This is a default monitoring group, which is a special NE 
                          monitoring group containing all NEs that support centralized RAN network monitoring 
                           on the entire network. The U2000 automatically monitors the alarms and disconnection 
                           statuses of all NEs by monitoring the global monitoring group. The global monitoring 
                           group cannot be deleted, renamed, or suspended. 

                     l    NE monitoring group: Created by users, an NE monitoring group contains the NEs that 
                           are required by users. In an NE monitoring group, you can create NEs of only one RAT. 
                          For an NE monitoring group, the U2000 monitors alarm statuses and disconnection 
                           statuses. NEs of different RATs support different monitoring functions. For details, see 
                          3.5 The centralized RAN network monitoring-supported NEs and functions. 

                     l     Cell monitoring group: Created by users, a cell monitoring group contains the cells that 
                           are required by users. In a cell monitoring group, you can create cells of only one RAT. 
                          For a cell monitoring group, the U2000 monitors cell alarm statuses, blockage statuses, 
                           availability statuses, and activation statuses. Cells of different RATs support different 
                          monitoring functions. For details, see 3.5 The centralized RAN network monitoring- 
                           supported NEs and functions. 

Instances of Monitoring Groups 

                     To manage the NEs and cells on the WRAN and GBSS networks efficiently, you can perform 
                     the following operations: 

                     l     Classify NEs of the same type into a monitoring group, for example, RNC monitoring 
                           group, NodeB monitoring group, BSC monitoring group, and BTS monitoring group. 

                     l     Classify cells of the same type into a monitoring group, for example, WCDMA cell 
                          monitoring group and GSM cell monitoring group. 

                     l     Classify the RNCs and BSCs and the managed NodeBs and BTSs into a RAN NE 
                          monitoring group so that you can concurrently monitor the NodeBs and BTSs when 
                          monitoring the RNCs and BSCs.

3.1.2 Configuration Model of Monitored Objects 

                       This section describes the configuration object models of the NEs that support centralized 
                       RAN network monitoring. This helps you to learn the logical relationships between monitored 
                       objects so that you can use the models when adjusting object configuration. 

                       Figure 3-1 shows the logical relationships between RNCs and NodeBs on the WRAN 
                       network and the cells on the WCDMA network.

3.1.3 Centralized RAN Network Monitoring 

                       The U2000 centrally monitors the RNCs/BSCs, NodeBs/BTSs, and cells on the WRAN and 
                       GBSS networks to meet routine monitoring requirements. This function also enables you to 
                       quickly identify exceptions and maintain devices. The U2000 can also query and modify 
                       configuration data. 

Monitoring Panel 

                       To perform centralized network monitoring, you create a required monitoring group and then 
                       monitor the objects in the monitoring group through the monitoring panel. The monitoring 
                       panel graphically displays the value of each monitoring item in the monitoring group, as 
                       shown in Figure 3-3. You can click a monitoring pane to view details related to the related 
                       monitoring item. The monitoring panel varies slightly depending on the monitored objects in 
                       the monitoring group and selected monitoring items. For details about monitoring groups, see 
                       3.1.1 Monitoring Groups. For details about how to create a monitoring group, see 3.2.1 
                       Adding a Monitoring Group.

Centralized GBSS Network Monitoring 

                        l    When creating a GBSS NE in an NE monitoring group, you can select a specific 
                             monitoring function to view the following information on the monitoring panel: 

                              –    Uncleared or unacknowledged alarms of each severity on the NE 

                              –    Disconnection status between the NE and the U2000 

                                   The disconnection for a GBTS refers to the disconnection between the GBTS and 
                                   the GBSC to which it belongs. 

                        l    When creating a GSM cell in a cell monitoring group, you can select a specific 
                             monitoring function to view the uncleared or unacknowledged alarms of each severity on 
                             the cell on the monitoring panel.

3.2 Monitoring Groups Management 

                     This section describes how to manage monitoring groups. You can classify the objects related 
                     to a certain service into a group called a monitoring group, and then monitor these objects in 
                     real time together. In addition to creating a monitoring group as required, you can delete, 
                     modify, rename, suspend, or activate an existing monitoring group. 

3.2.1 Adding a Monitoring Group 

                     This section describes how to add a monitoring group. You can classify the objects related to 
                     a certain service into a monitoring group and specify the monitoring items to uniformly 
                     monitor the objects in the monitoring group in real time. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                     l    You are authorized to perform centralized network monitoring. 

Context 

                     l    Each user can create a maximum of six monitoring groups. A maximum of 100 
                          monitoring groups can be created on the entire network. 

                     l    If a non-admin user is deleted, all the monitoring groups created by this user are deleted. 

                     l    NetworkIntegrationMonitor has been enabled in OSMU. This component is disabled by 
                          default. For details about how to manually enable or disable this component, see 
                          Managing Components in  U2000 OSMU User Guide.

3.4.3 Parameters for Collecting Statistics on Alarms of the 
Monitored Objects 

                        This section describes how to collect statistics on alarms as required. The statistics on the 
                        objects in the RNC monitored group can be collected by alarm severity, alarm ID, alarm type, 
                        and TopN, while the statistics on the objects such as NodeB and BSC6000 in the monitored 
                        groups only can be collected by alarm severity, alarm ID, and alarm type. 

Basic Conditions for Alarm Statistics 

                        Before collecting statistics on alarms, you need to set the basic statistic conditions. For details 
                        about basic condition parameters, see Table 3-2.

               4 Multimode Base Station Management 

About This Chapter 

                     A multimode base station supports multiple RATs, and can work in dual or triple modes. A 
                     multimode base station can also work in co-MPT or separate-MPT mode, depending on the 
                     RAT deployment on the main control board.

                     view. 

                     4.2 Managing Co-MPT Multimode Base Stations 
                     Managing co-MPT multimode base stations is the same as managing single-mode base 
                     stations. For details, see the descriptions of related functions in the U2000 Help. 

                     4.3 Managing Separate-MPT Multimode Base Stations 
                     This section describes how to manage separate-MPT base stations by using the functions 
                     provided by the U2000. Using these functions, you can consider an separate-MPT base station 
                     as independent NEs of different RATs and perform separate management on them. You can 
                     also consider a separate-MPT base station as one device and perform central management.

                        Managing co-MPT multimode base stations is the same as managing single-mode base 
                        stations. For details, see the descriptions of related functions in the U2000 Help. 

4.3 Managing Separate-MPT Multimode Base Stations 

                        This section describes how to manage separate-MPT base stations by using the functions 
                        provided by the U2000. Using these functions, you can consider an separate-MPT base station 
                        as independent NEs of different RATs and perform separate management on them. You can 
                        also consider a separate-MPT base station as one device and perform central management.

4.3.1 Verifying the Binding Relationships of Separate-MPT Base 
Stations 

                      This section describes how to verify the binding relationships of separate-MPT base stations 
                      on the live network. By manually verifying or enabling the U2000 to automatically verify the 
                      binding relationships on a scheduled basis, you can learn about separate-MPT base stations on 
                      the live network and identify incorrect binding relationships. 

Prerequisites 

                      You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

Context 

                      l     The U2000 can verify the binding relationships of all NEs on the entire network or 
                            specified separate-MPT base stations. 

                               NOTE 

                                 All NEs on the entire network refer to all base stations managed by the U2000. 

                      l     A task for verifying the binding relationships of an separate-MPT base station on a 
                            scheduled basis is a system scheduled task and is suspended by default. You can start this 
                            task as required and modify related task parameters such as execution period. After you 
                            start a scheduled task, it is performed once a day by default. 

                      l     When you manually verify or enable the U2000 to verify the binding relationships of 
                            separate-MPT base stations on a scheduled basis, the U2000 can automatically identify 
                            the base stations whose BBUs are connected, bind such base stations as an separate-MPT 
                            base station, and display it on the client. 

                      l     The database may be disconnected during the check if checking the separate-MPT base 
                            station binding relationships fails. 

Procedure 

                      l     Manually verifying the binding relationships of separate-MPT base stations 

                            a.   Choose Configuration > MBTS Management > MBTS Relationship 
                                 Management (traditional style); alternatively, double-click Configuration in 
                                 Application Center and choose Settings > MBTS Management > MBTS 
                                 Relationship Management (application style). 

                            b.   Click the Check Correlations tab. 

                            c.   Click       and select Check All NEs or Check By MBTS to verify the binding 
                                 relationships of separate-MPT base stations.

                                         parameters, see Table 4-2. 

                                       NOTE 

                                        The U2000 requires base station ESNs in the U2000 database when verifying binding 
                                        relationships of base stations and automatically updates ESNs of base stations on the entire 
                                        network every night. After base station ESNs change, if you need to check binding 
                                        relationships of base stations before the automatic update at night, you can select Check all 
                                        NEs with synchronizing ESNs or Check selected NEs without synchronizing ESNs as 
                                        required. In such a case, the check takes a longer time. 

                                        In normal cases, the ESN information of an NE does not change. It possibly changes only 
                                        after the MPT or BBU subrack is replaced and needs to be synchronized.

4.3.2 Specifying the Binding Relationship of an Separate-MPT 
Base Station 

                       This section describes how to specify the binding relationship of an separate-MPT base 
                       station on the U2000. After you manually bind two or three base stations to create an 
                       separate-MPT base station, the U2000 displays an separate-MPT base station in the topology 
                       view for subsequent integrated management and maintenance. The U2000 also allows you to 
                       manually unbind the separate-MPT base station.

Prerequisites 

                     l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                     l    The base stations in different RATs have been commissioned and displayed in the 
                          topology view on the U2000 client. 

                     l    Optional: You are advised to set the priorities of RATs before specifying the binding 
                          relationship of an separate-MPT base station. This avoids repeatedly managing common 
                          data for the involved base stations. For details, see 4.3.3 Setting Priorities for RATs 
                          Supported by a Separate-MPT Base Station. 

Context 

                     l    The U2000 does not automatically check the consistency of common data after you 
                          create an separate-MPT base station by binding base stations. Therefore, you need to 
                          manually ensure the consistency of the common data. 

                     l    If the BBUs of the specified base stations are not connected to each other, you need to 
                          manually bind the base stations to create a dual-mode or triple-mode base station. Then 
                          the U2000 displays an separate-MPT base station in the topology view. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose Configuration > MBTS Management > MBTS Relationship Management 
                     (traditional style); alternatively, double-click Configuration in Application Center and

4.3.3 Setting Priorities for RATs Supported by a Separate-MPT 
Base Station 

                       This section describes how to set RAT priorities on the U2000 before connecting a separate- 
                       MPT base station to the U2000. After you set the priorities, the single-mode base station to 
                       which the common data such as common alarms and common board data belongs is 
                       determined and you do not need to repeatedly manage common data in the future. After you 
                       set an RAT with the highest priority, the data reported by the single-mode base station of this 
                       RAT is displayed as the common data in the topology view. The operation commands related 
                       to the common data, however, are delivered to all single-mode base stations. RAT priorities 
                       are applied to all the separate-MPT base stations on the network. 

Prerequisites 

                       l     You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                       l     You are authorized to set the priorities for the RATs supported by separate-MPT base 
                             stations.

4.3.5 Managing the Separate-MPT Base Station File 

                      With the MBTS Proxy File Management function, when the OM channel between an NE 
                      under separate-MPT base station and the U2000 is faulty, the OM channel for another NE can 
                      be used for transmitting related files of the faulty NE to the U2000 server so that remote fault 
                      location can be performed on the faulty NE without the need of local fault location. 

Prerequisites 

                      l     You are authorized to use the MBTS proxy file management function. 

                      l     The MBTS proxy file management function has been enabled. 

                            Choose File > Preferences (application style) or System > Preferences (traditional 
                            style). In the left navigation tree in the displayed Preferences dialog box, select SWM 
                            Preferences and Display the MBTS Proxy File Management menu. Restarting the 
                            client is not required. 

Context 

                      This function provides the MBTS emergency OM channel so that OM engineers can perform 
                      the following maintenance operations when the OM channel of a certain NE is faulty: 

                      l     Configuration files and certificate files have been uploaded to the OSS. Faulty NEs can 
                            download files from the OSS using the normal OM channel.

About This Chapter 

                    Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) dynamically reuseg some GSM spectrum resources 
                    between the GSM and UMTS networks based on the feature that the busy hours of GSM 
                    voice services and UMTS data services are different. This increases spectrum utilization and 
                    reduces costs of data services. With the GU DSS management feature, the U2000 can share 
                     spectrums or reclaim shared spectrums by setting related parameters. 

                     5.1 Overview of GU DSS 
                    This section provides the background, feature description, process, and specifications of GU 
                    dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS). 

                     5.2 Creating a DSS Task 
                    This section describes how to create a DSS task on the U2000 to dynamically share and 
                    reclaim spectrums. 

                     5.3 Managing a DSS Task 
                    This section describes how to manage a dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) task. After you 
                    create a DSS task, you can start, modify, stop, or delete the task in the main window for 
                     spectrum sharing.

5.1 Overview of GU DSS 

                     This section provides the background, feature description, process, and specifications of GU 
                     dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS). 

Definition and Benefits 

                     GU DSS is applicable to telecom operators who own both GSM and UMTS (referred to as 
                     GU) networks. GU DSS reuses some spectrums based on the feature that the busy hours of 
                     GSM voice services and UMTS data services are different. This increases spectral efficiency 
                     and data throughput. For example, you can spare 5 MHz of spectrums from the 900 MHz 
                     GSM frequency band to share with the UMTS network. 

                     GU DSS divides the spectrums of the GSM network into basic and shared spectrums and 
                     dynamically reuses the shared spectrums between the GSM and UMTS networks. For 
                     example, if you have 10 MHz bandwidth, configure GBTSs as S4/4/4. 

                     l    When the traffic volume on a GSM network is low, the GBSC automatically 
                          reconfigures GBTSs as S2/2/2 and spares 5 MHz bandwidth for the RNC. The RNC 
                          configures a UMTS cell and assigns the 5 MHz bandwidth to the cell to provide UMTS 
                          services. 

                     l    When the traffic volume on a GSM network is high, the GBSC reclaims the 5 MHz 
                          bandwidth and reconfigures the GBTSs as S4/4/4. 

Feature Description 

                     Network elements involved in GU dynamic spectrum sharing and reclaiming are the U2000, 
                     BSC6900s, BSC6910s, and MBTSs. They provide the following functions during the DSS 
                     process: 

                     l    The U2000 functions as the main control device and is used to trigger DSS and forward 
                          control information between the GBSC and RNC. 

                     l    The BSC6900s control spectrum sharing and reclaiming on GBTSs and NodeBs. 

                     l    MBTSs perform operations such as adding or deleting carriers and coordinating 
                          interference. 

                     DSS provides the following subfunctions: 

                     l    Managing DSS tasks 

                          You can create, modify, delete, start, and stop DSS tasks. Select base station pairs and set 
                          sharing time when creating a DSS task. Select base station pairs. Spectrums are shared 
                          between base stations that are set to pairs. A DSS task contains one or more base station 
                          pairs. When the preset sharing time expires, the U2000 instructs the GBSC to trigger 
                          spectrum sharing or reclaiming. 

                     l    Controlling DSS process 

                          The U2000 is the main control device that dynamically schedules spectrums in the whole 
                          DSS process. During spectrum sharing, it ensures that spectrums under GBTSs in a task 
                          are shared before they are activated under NodeBs. During spectrum reclaiming, it 
                          ensures that the spectrums being shared are released under NodeBs before they are 
                          activated under GBTSs.

                             The U2000 checks usage of spectrums under GBTSs and NodeBs on a scheduled basis to 
                             ensure that the spectrums are reused properly. 

Process 

                       Table 5-1 shows the process of activating DSS.

                         1. Assessment      Before activating DSS, assess traffic volume to determine areas to share 
                                            spectrums on the live network and time to share the spectrums. 

                         2. Plan            Use network plan tools to export planned parameters related to DSS. 

                         3.                 Use configuration tools to put the planned parameters into effect.

                                                based on the exported planned parameters, and then make the scripts 
                                                take effect on NEs. 

                                            l   If the CME is not deployed, use other configuration tools to generate 
                                                configuration scripts based on the exported planned parameters, and 
                                                then make the scripts take effect on NEs.

                          DSS, however, cannot exceed 100. 

5.2 Creating a DSS Task 

                     This section describes how to create a DSS task on the U2000 to dynamically share and 
                     reclaim spectrums. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                     l    You have the permission to perform DSS. 

                     l    Both the base stations and controllers support DSS. 

                     l    Parameters related to DSS have been configured by using configuration tools. 

Context 

                     l    Trigger conditions of automatic spectrum sharing: Traffic volume in the cells whose 
                          spectrums are to be shared falls below a certain threshold within a sharing period.

                          volume exceeds a certain threshold within a sharing period. 

                     l    The coverage types for base stations within the shared area are as follows: Normal, 
                          Small, and Bufferzone. 

                           –   If a base station on the edge of the shared area has shared UMTS cells, set the 
                               coverage type of the base station to Small. This reduces co-channel interference 
                               between the shared UMTS cells and neighboring GSM cells. 

                           –   If a base station on the edge of the shared area has no shared UMTS cells, set the 
                               coverage type of the base station to Bufferzone. This reduces co-channel interface 
                               between the GSM cells under the base station and neighboring UMTS shared cells. 

                           –   If a base station is in the center of the shared area, set the coverage type to Normal 
                               because there is no co-channel interference between the shared UMTS cells and 
                               neighboring GSM cells. 

                          Set coverage type as required when you create a DSS task. 

                     l    The U2000 allows you to immediately share or reclaim spectrums. In this case, the 
                          system does not wait for the NEs to determine whether sharing or reclaiming conditions 
                          are met.

About This Chapter 

                     A license governs the usage and redistribution of a product, such as the product function, 
                     applicable territory, and validity period. It is granted by Huawei to an operator as an element 
                     of an agreement between them, giving the operator permission to use certain functions 
                     provided by the product within a specified territory and validity period. An operator can 
                     flexibly select network functions and capacity applicable to a certain stage by purchasing 
                     related licenses, thereby minimizing investment. The U2000 provides NE license 
                     management functions, such as uploading, activation, and allocation. 

Context 

                     Physical forms of licenses are license certificates and license files. 

                      l    A license certificate is a hard copy of a license, recording information, such as the 
                           product name, License Authorization Code (LAC), customer name, and validity period. 
                           It is usually delivered to customers with the product. 

                      l    A license file is an electronic document containing the information about the capacity 
                           and function service of a product. It is generated according to customer orders. 

                     Unless otherwise specified, licenses in this document are license files.

                     in the stand-alone license. In stand-alone license management, you can query, apply for, 
                     install, and change a stand-alone license. In addition, you can adjust the capacities defined in 
                     the license. The license controls the validity period or functions of an NE. Therefore, you 
                     need to view the license state and change the expired license. Otherwise, services will be 
                     affected. 

                     6.10 LTE License Planning Data Management 
                     The U2000 supports export of key configuration data, performance data, and license

6.2 CN NE License Management 

                     An NE license defines the available functions and resources for an NE. You can manage 
                      licenses of CN NEs on the U2000, such as loading and activating licenses. 

6.2.1 Overview of the CN NE License 

                      The licenses for the network elements (NEs) of the core network (CN) are controlled and 
                      delivered by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. The licenses are centrally managed through the 
                     U2000. 

Classification of CN NE Licenses 

                      The CN NE license is classified into the following types: 

                      l    Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After a 
                           user has purchased a commercial license, the CN NEs of this user can use all resources 
                           and provide all functions within a time period specified in the commercial license. 

                      l    Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei directly and do not need to pay 
                           for them. After a user has obtained a trial license, the CN NEs of this user can use trial

                           resources and provide trial functions within a time period specified in the trial license. 
                           The default validity period of a trial license is three months. 

                     The license management function currently applies to MGW and MSC Server (ATCA) of the 
                     CN. 

License Management Mode 

                      l    The U2000 manages licenses centrally. You need to first upload an obtained license to 
                           the U2000 server. Then, the U2000 delivers the license to a specific NE to complete the 
                           license loading. 

                      l    Each CN NE has an independent license. 

License Application Scenarios 

                     Telecom operators need to apply for licenses in the following scenarios. When multiple 
                     telecom operators share one network, only the primary telecom operator needs to apply for a 
                     license. 

                      l    A new CN NE is deployed. 

                      l    The equipment serial number (ESN) of an NE is changed. 

                      l    New functions are introduced and the NE capacity is expanded upon NE upgrade or 
                           capacity expansion. 

6.2.2 CN NE License Operation Process 

                     This section describes the process for managing licenses of CN NEs on the U2000. 

6.2.2.1 Loading a License 

                     An NE license defines the available functions and resources for an NE. You need to load an 
                     obtained license on a specific NE so that the license can be activated and the NE can operate 
                     with authorized functions and resources. 

Prerequisites 

                      l    You have successfully applied for a valid license and saved it on the local client. 

                      l    The connection between the NE on which the license is to be loaded and the U2000 is 
                           normal. 

Context 

                     The license management function currently applies to MGW and MSC Server (ATCA) of the 
                     CN. 

Procedure 

                      l    For details about how to load a license on a specific NE through the U2000 client, see 
                           Transferring NE Files. 

                      l    Upload a license to the U2000 server through the U2000 client, and then the U2000 
                           server delivers the license to a specific NE. 

                           a.   Upload a license to the U2000 server.

Prerequisites 

                      The license has been loaded on the NE. 

Context 

                      The license management function currently applies to MGW of the CN. This section uses the 
                      FIXMGW as an example to describes how to activate a license. The operations for other NEs 
                      are similar. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose Choose Software > Software Browser (traditional style); alternatively, double-click 
                      Software Management in Application Center and choose NE File > Software Browser 
                      (application style).. The Software Browser window is displayed. 

             Step 2   Click the NE tab. Expand NE > FIXMGW and select a FIXMGW. 

             Step 3   Click the License tab in the right pane. 

                      The tab page displays information about the license loaded on the FIXMGW. 

             Step 4    Select a license to be activated and click Activate. The Activate License File window is 
                      displayed. 

             Step 5    Select the operator, set the related parameters, and then click OK. 

                      During activation, the NE verifies this license file. The verification involves the following 
                      aspects: 

                       l    File validity verification: verifies that the license file matches the NE, is not corrupted, 
                            and does not expire. If the license file is invalid, the activation fails. 

                       l    Authorization resource value verification: verifies that the total number of resources used

6.3 Controller License Management 

                      A controller license defines the available functions and resources for a controller. You can 
                      manage the controller license on the U2000, such as loading and activating the license. 

6.3.1 Overview of the Controller License 

                      This section describes controller licenses that are controlled and delivered by Huawei 
                      Technologies Co., Ltd and centrally managed through the U2000. Controller license current 
                      support BSC6000(GSMR), BSC6900 GSM, BSC6900 UMTS, BSC6900 GU, BSC6910 
                      GSM, BSC6910 UMTS, BSC6910 GU, and ECO6910.

Classification of Controller Licenses 

                      The controller license is classified into the following types: 

                      l    Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After a 
                           user has purchased a commercial license, the controllers of this user can use all resources 
                           and provide all functions within a time period specified in the commercial license. 

                      l    Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei directly and do not need to pay 
                           for them. After a user has obtained a trial license, the controllers of this user can use trial 
                           resources and provide trial functions within a time period specified in the trial license. 
                           The default validity period of a trial license is three months. 

License Management Mode 

                      l    The U2000 uniformly manages license. You can deliver the licenses for which you have 
                           applied to base station controllers and load them on the controllers. 

                      l    Each base station controller has an independent license. 

License Application Scenarios 

                      Telecom operators need to apply for licenses in the following scenarios. When multiple 
                      telecom operators share one network, only the primary telecom operator needs to apply for a 
                      license. 

                      l    A new base station controller is deployed. 

                      l    The Equipment serial number (ESN) of a base station controller is changed. 

                      l    New functions are introduced and the controller capacity is expanded upon controller 
                           upgrade or capacity expansion. 

6.3.2 Common Operations on the Controller License 

                      This section describes common operations on the controller license. 

6.3.2.1 Loading a Controller License 

                      This section describes how to load a controller license. A controller license defines available 
                      functions and resources for a base station controller. You need to load an obtained license on a 
                      specific base station controller so that the license can be activated and the base station 
                      controller can operate with authorized functions and resources. 

Prerequisites 

                      l    You have obtained a valid license and saved it on the local client. 

                      l    The connection is normal between the base station controller on which the license is to 
                           be loaded and the U2000. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > BSC (traditional style); alternatively, double- 
                      click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > BSC 
                      (application style). The BSC License Management window is displayed.

6.3.2.2 Activating a Controller License 

                     A controller license can function only after it is activated. Once a controller license is loaded 
                      on a base station controller, it is inactive by default, and you need to manually activate the 
                      license. 

Prerequisites 

                      The license has been loaded on the base station controller. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > BSC (traditional style); alternatively, double- 
                      click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > BSC 
                      (application style). The BSC License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2    Click a base station controller whose license needs to be activated in the navigation tree in the 
                      left pane. The license management tab page of this controller is displayed in the right pane. 
                      The information about the license that has been loaded on the base station controller is 
                      displayed in the license information list. 

            Step 3    Select a license to be activated and click Activate. The Activate License File window is 
                      displayed. 

            Step 4    Set related parameters and click OK.

                                   NOTICE 

                        l  During license activation, the base station controller verifies the license file to be 
                           activated. The license file that fails verification cannot be activated. The system prompts 
                           users whether to activate a license. After verifying that the license file does not contain the 
                           following problems, activate the license. The content to be verified is as follows: 

                           –     File validity verification: verifies that the license file matches the base station 
                                 controller, is not corrupted, and has not expired. If the license file is invalid, the 
                                 activation fails. 

                           –     Authorization resource value verification: verifies that the total number of resources 
                                 used by the base station controller is less than or equal to the number of resources 
                                 authorized by the license file. If the number of used resources exceeds the number of 
                                 authorized resources, the activation fails. 

                           –     ESN verification: verifies that the license file's ESN is consistent with the base 
                                 station controller's ESN. If the ESNs are inconsistent, the license file cannot be 
                                 activated. 

                        l  If the controller license is in the local management state, the base station controller 
                           provides services based on the license file after the license file is activated. 

                        l  If the controller license is in the network management state, services on the base station 
                           controller are not affected after the license file is activated. Only the currently activated 
                           controller license file is updated. 

                           NOTE 

                             The U2000 allows users to activate the controller license by running a one-time scheduled activation 
                             task in the task management module. To navigate to the activation task window, choose Maintenance > 
                             Task Management from the main menu, and then choose Task Type > Other > BSC/RNC License 
                             Timed Activation from the navigation tree. For details about the parameters for creating scheduled 
                             activation tasks, see 6.3.3.2 Parameters for Creating/Modifying Scheduled Controller License 
                             Activation Tasks. 

                       ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                       You need to update the license file when new functions are introduced or the controller 
                        capacity is expanded upon controller upgrade or capacity expansion. The old license will be 
                       deactivated after the new license is activated, and you can delete the inactive license. For 
                       details about how to delete a license file, see 6.3.2.4 Managing the Controller License. 

6.3.2.3 Viewing Controller License Information 

                       The U2000 provides the license view function so that users can view the license information 
                        about base station controllers on the live network. 

Prerequisites 

                        l    You have logged in to the U2000 client.

6.3.2.5 Periodically Backing Up an NE License 

                         During a periodic license file backup, the U2000 periodically backs up the active license on 
                         NEs. After a periodic task for NE license backup is created and started, the U2000 backs up 
                         the related NE license file to a specified directory on the U2000 server on a scheduled basis. 
                         The backup is used for restoring a license file when the file is lost or NE exceptions occur. 

Prerequisites 

                         An active license file is available on an NE.

Context 

                      l    Currently, the U2000 can periodically back up the licenses of only the 
                           BSC6000(GSMR), BSC6900 GSM, BSC6900 UMTS, BSC6900 GU, BSC6910 GSM, 
                           BSC6910 UMTS, BSC6910 GU and ECO6910. 

                      l    You can use the following method to view licenses after NE license backup: 

                           Choose Software > Software Browser (traditional style); alternatively, double-click 
                           Software Management in Application Center and choose NE File > Software 
                           Browser(application style). In the displayed Software Browser window, click the OSS 
                           Server tab. Then, select a desired base station controller node under the OSS Server 
                           node and click License on the right. 

                      l    Name of a backup file: refers to the name of an NE license, for example, 
                           ON1020093_GO1.dat. 

                      l    There is no limit on the number of backup files that can be saved on the U2000 server. 
                           Files with the same names are overwritten during backup. 

                      l    Backup task settings: You can create a backup task for NEs of a certain type or for a 
                           specific NE. The U2000 supports both periodic and one-time backup tasks. The backup 
                           period can be set to Day, Week, or Month. 

                                 NOTICE 

                      l   The recommended backup period is one week, which means that the backup is performed 
                          once a week. You can customize backup periods. 

                      l  You can create a maximum of 50 backup tasks. When the total number of tasks for 
                         backing up NE licenses on the server reaches 50, no more tasks of this type can be created.

                                NOTE 

                                  –    Start Time must be later than the current server time 

                                  –    If Execution Type is set to One-time, the Start Time parameter is invalid after you select 
                                       Run now. In addition, the task is performed immediately after the setting is complete. 

                       2.    If you have set Execution Type to Periodic in Step 3, set Execution interval and 
                             Times or End time. 

                             –    Execution interval refers to the interval for executing the periodic task, which 
                                  consists of the unit and interval of the period. 

                             –    Times refers to the number of times for executing the task during an execution 
                                  period. If Times is 0, the number of times is not limited. 

                             –    End time refers to the end time of the task. 

                       For example, if you set Start Time, Execution interval, and Times to 08/04/2009 14:43:16, 
                       1Day, and 1, respectively, the U2000 performs the NE license backup task once every day, 
                       starting from 2009-04-08 14:43:16. 

             Step 5    Click Next and select a backup mode and NEs to be backed up. 

                       You can select By NE type, Specified NEs or By region. Specified NEs is selected by 
                       default. 

                       l     By NE type indicates that the U2000 exports licenses for all NEs of this type, including 
                             licenses for newly added NEs of this type. 

                       l     Specified NEs indicates that the U2000 exports licenses for the selected NEs. 

                       l     By region indicates that the U2000 exports licenses for all NEs in this region, including 
                             licenses for newly added NEs in this region. 

             Step 6    Click Finish. 

                       The added NE license backup task is displayed in the task list of the Task Management 
                       window.

Classification of Licenses 

                       The license is classified into the following types: 

                       l    Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After a 
                            user has purchased a commercial license, the Cloud NEs of this user can use all 
                            resources and provide all functions within a time period specified in the commercial 
                            license. 

                       l    Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei directly and do not need to pay 
                            for them. After a user has obtained a trial license, the Cloud NEs of this user can use trial 
                            resources and provide trial functions within a time period specified in the trial license. 
                            The default validity period of a trial license is three months.

6.4.2.4 Revoking a Cloud NE License 

                        This section describes how to update a Cloud NE license when the capacity specified in the 
                        Cloud NE license, the ESN, or the telecom operator name needs to be changed. You can 
                        revoke the current Cloud NE license on your U2000 client to obtain a revoked code, and then 
                        send the revoked code to Huawei technical support engineers who will help you apply for a 
                        new Cloud NE license. This function helps you obtain a new Cloud NE license quickly. 

Prerequisites 

                        l    NEs are properly connected to the U2000. 

                        l     This function is applicable only to vUGWs, vUSNs, vEPSNs, vSCEFs, vCGs, eLTE-IoT,

Context 

                        l     After an activated Cloud NE license is revoked, it enters a grace period of 60 days. 
                              Licensed resources and functions can be used during the grace period. After the grace 
                             period, the Cloud NE license becomes invalid and only default resources and functions

                               can be used. Therefore, you must upload the license and activate it within the grace 
                               period. 

                         l     An inactive license cannot be revoked. 

Procedure

                              l   You can press Ctrl+c to copy the revoked code in the displayed dialog box. 

                              l   If you revoke a license repeatedly on the U2000, the U2000 displays information indicating that this 
                                  license has been revoked and provides the revoked code. 

                              l   The U2000 does not provide revoked codes in the following scenarios: 

                                  –     A license is deleted and then uploaded again to an NE. 

                                  –     A revoked license exists on an NE, that is, the revoke code exists. An NE is then created on 
                                        the current U2000.

6.5 eGBTS License Management 

                     This section describes how to manage eGBTS licenses. The eGBTS license of a BSC defines 
                     the functions and resources available for the eGBTSs managed by this BSC in normal 
                     scenarios. You can use the U2000 to manage the eGBTS license, including uploading, 
                     allocating, synchronizing, importing, and exporting the license. 

Context 

                     The eGBTS mentioned in this section refers to the co-MPT base station in the GSM mode. 

6.5.1 Overview of the eGBTS License 

                     This section describes the management, validity, and automatic verification of eGBTS 
                     licenses. 

6.5.1.1 eGBTS License Management 

                     This section describes the management of eGBTS licenses. eGBTS licenses are issued by 
                     Huawei and are centrally managed on the U2000. 

Classification of eGBTS Licenses 

                     eGBTS licenses are classified into the following types: 

                      l    Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After the 
                           purchase, the eGBTSs of this user can use all resources within a time period specified in 
                           the commercial license. 

                      l    Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei for free. After a user has 
                           obtained a trial license, the eGBTSs of this user can use certain resources within a time 
                           period specified in the trial license during BSC commissioning. The default validity 
                           period of a trial license is three months. 

Management of eGBTS Licenses 

                     The U2000 centrally manages eGBTS licenses. For details, see Figure 6-5.

                       l    An eGBTS license is generated based on the equipment serial number (ESN) of the BSC 
                            to which the eGBTS belongs, and is shared by all eGBTSs managed by this BSC. The 
                            license allocation values can be modified between eGBTSs. 

                       l    The eGBTS license files are saved on the U2000 server. 

                       l    The total number of resources allocated to all eGBTSs managed by a BSC cannot exceed 
                            the number of resources specified in the corresponding eGBTS license. In addition, the 
                            resources of one BSC cannot be allocated to eGBTSs managed by another BSC. 

Scenarios in Which You Need to Apply for a License 

                       l    Creating a BSC 

                       l    Changing the BSC ESN 

                       l    Expanding the capacity and functions of an eGBTS after this eGBTS is upgraded or 
                            expanded 

                            The license for a new eGBTS version includes all functions and resources authorized by 
                            the license for an earlier eGBTS version. Therefore, an eGBTS can still provide all 
                            existing functions and use all existing resources after it is upgraded. 

                       l    Reparenting an eGBTS 

                       l    Evolving a GBTS into an eGBTS 

6.5.1.2 eGBTS License Validity and Automatic Verification 

                      This section describes the eGBTS license validity, processing mechanism for exceeded 
                      eGBTS license allocation values, and automatic verification of eGBTS licenses.

eGBTS License Validity 

                       If the equipment identification information matches the ESN in the eGBTS license and the 
                       eGBTS license has not expired, the license file is valid. Otherwise, the license file is invalid. 
                       The following two methods are used to process valid and invalid license files: 

                       If the license file is invalid: The U2000 generates the ALM-501 License Invalid alarm. 

                       If the license file is valid: 

                       l     If the license is within 30 days before the validity period, the U2000 sends an EVT-503 
                             License To Be On Trial event. 

                       l     The license enters a 60-day grace period after it expires. The license remains valid 
                             during the grace period and becomes invalid after the grace period. After the license 
                             becomes invalid, eGBTSs can use only the default resources. 

                       l     The U2000 generates the EVT-504 License Expiring event and ALM-506 License On 
                             Trial alarm during the 60-day grace period after the license expires. 

                       l     The U2000 generates the ALM-505 License Expired alarm after the 60-day grace 
                             period. 

Processing Mechanism for Exceeded eGBTS License Allocation Values 

                       The license allocation value exceeds the limit when the assigned license allocation value is 
                       greater than the authorized allocation value of the eGBTS license. This happens when an 
                       eGBTS newly accesses the U2000 and the initial license allocation value of the eGBTS plus 
                       the license values already assigned to the existing eGBTSs are greater than the authorized 
                       allocation value of the eGBTS license. 

                       If a newly admitted eGBTS has the initial license allocation value but the U2000 does not 
                       have the license allocation value for this eGBTS, the processing mechanism for exceeded 
                       eGBTS license values is as follows: 

                       1.    If the eGBTS license value does not exceed the limit after the U2000 is upgraded, the 
                             U2000 assigns its remaining value of the eGBTS license or the initial license allocation 
                             value (whichever is less) to the eGBTS. Then the U2000 recalculates the remaining 
                             value of the eGBTS license and delivers it to the BSC. 

                                NOTE 

                                  If the remaining value of the eGBTS license on the U2000 is less than the initial license allocation 
                                  value on the eGBTS, ALM-527 License Value Automatically Assigned by the U2000 to the 
                                  Base Station Less Than the Initial License Value of the Base Station is reported. 

                       2.    If the eGBTS license value exceeds the limit after the U2000 is upgraded, the following 
                             processing applies: 

                             –    For an eGBTS that accesses the U2000 within 60 days after the eGBTS license 
                                  value exceeds the limit (after the U2000 upgrade), the processing mechanism is the 
                                  same as that described in 1. 

                             –    For an eGBTS that accesses the U2000 60 days after the eGBTS license value 
                                  exceeds the limit, the U2000 clears the initial license allocation value on the 
                                  eGBTS. 

eGBTS License Automatic Verification 

                       The U2000 automatically checks the validity period of an eGBTS license, consistency 
                       between the license information saved on the U2000 and that saved on eGBTSs, and the 
                       number of resources allocated to the eGBTSs.

                          NOTE 

                           The remaining eGBTS license allocation values allocated to the BSC are irrelevant to the BSC license. 
                           These values are only delivered to GBTSs by the BSC. 

6.5.3 Common Operations for eGBTS License Management 

                      This section describes the common operations for eGBTS license management. 

6.5.3.1 Querying the BSC ESN 

                      This section describes how to query the ESN of a BSC before you apply for an eGBTS 
                      license. All the eGBTSs managed by a BSC share one eGBTS license. 

Prerequisites 

                      l     The BSC connects to the U2000 properly. 

                      l     The ESN of the BSC has been reported to the U2000. 

Context 

                      The originating signaling point (OSP) and destination signaling point (DSP) are sequenced 
                      and encrypted to form the ESN of a BSC. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                      eGBTS (application style). The eGBTS License Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2   Query the ESN of a BSC, as shown in Figure 6-14.

                      ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                      Contact Huawei technical support to apply for an eGBTS license based on the queried ESN.

6.5.3.2 Uploading the eGBTS License to the U2000 Server 

                      This section describes how to upload an eGBTS license to the U2000 server before you 
                      allocate the license to eGBTSs through the U2000 client. The eGBTSs do not store license 
                      information. Therefore, all license-related operations are performed on the U2000. 

Prerequisites 

                      You have obtained a valid eGBTS license. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                      eGBTS (application style). The eGBTS License Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2   Upload the eGBTS license, as shown in Figure 6-15.

                           NOTE 

                             l    You can upload multiple eGBTS licenses for one BSC. Only one license can be active at a time. 

                             l    System time refers to the time on the U2000 server rather than the time on the U2000 client. 

                             l    If a license fails to be uploaded, you can view the cause of the failure in upload logs. 

                       After an eGBTS license is uploaded to the U2000 server, you can double-click it to view 
                       details. For details about the parameters, see 6.5.4.2 Parameters for eGBTS License 
                       Information.

6.5.3.3 Setting Thresholds for Allocating eGBTS License Resources (Optional) 

                       This section describes how to set thresholds for allocating eGBTS license resources. You can 
                       set a threshold for the ratio of allocated resources to authorized resources. When the ratio 
                       exceeds the threshold, the U2000 generates the ALM-519 The Proportion of Distributed 
                       License Is Too High alarm. This alarm alerts you to the situation that excess resources are 
                       allocated in real time. 

Context 

                       Setting license allocation thresholds is disabled by default. You can enable this function and 
                       set specific thresholds on the U2000 client. If you do not need to observe license resource 
                       allocation ratios, disable this function to prevent the U2000 from generating unnecessary 
                       alarms. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                       double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                       eGBTS (application style). The eGBTS License Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2    Set thresholds for allocating eGBTS license resources, as shown in Figure 6-16. Table 6-7 
                       describes the parameters for setting thresholds.

                             and U2000 is established, the U2000 automatically delivers the allocated license.

Result 

                        Before the U2000 delivers a license to an eGBTS, the U2000 delivers a message to the 
                        eGBTS and queries the eGBTS license: 

                        l     If the queried license is not the same as that to be delivered on the U2000, the latter 
                              prevails and the U2000 will deliver full license allocation values. 

                        l     If the queried license is the same as that to be delivered on the U2000, the U2000 does 
                              not deliver setting information to eGBTSs. This does not affect eGBTSs. 

                            NOTE 

                             After an U2000 upgrade or license capacity expansion, the license control items delivered to eGBTSs 
                             are still valid. 

                        If the total number of resources used by eGBTSs exceeds the licensed value because the 
                        resources are not correctly planned or set, the license resource allocation fails. In addition, the 
                        U2000 generates the ALM-526 Excessive License Usage alarm. You need to reset the license 
                        resources used by eGBTSs and allocate the license again.

                      This section describes how to view the detailed eGBTS license information, including 
                      viewing the attributes of the current license of a specified BSC and the license allocation 
                      information between eGBTSs on the U2000 client. 

Context 

                       l    For a license item in an eGBTS license, you can set different allocation values for the 
                            eGBTSs managed by the BSC. The sum of the allocation values, however, must be less 
                            than the maximum value specified in the license. 

                       l    You can manually modify the eGBTS license allocation information. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License >

6.5.3.8 Synchronizing an eGBTS License 

                       This section describes how to synchronize the license control item values on an eGBTS with 
                       the license control item values on the U2000 server when the values between them are not the 
                        same. The inconsistency may occur when the eGBTS is under maintenance, the eGBTS file 
                        system is damaged, or the eGBTS license file is deleted. In this case, the U2000 automatically 
                        synchronizes the license of the managed eGBTS on a scheduled basis every day. You can also 
                       manually synchronize the eGBTS license allocation information to eGBTSs.

                       The U2000 checks whether the information reported by eGBTSs is consistent with the 
                       information saved on the server during license synchronization. 

                       l     If the total number of resources used by all the eGBTSs in the current BSC exceeds the 
                             licensed value, the U2000 reports the ALM-526 Excessive License Usage alarm. 

                       l     If the resource control item values used by eGBTSs are inconsistent with the 
                             corresponding values on the server, you can manually synchronize the eGBTS license 
                             allocation information to eGBTSs. 

                           NOTE 

                            l   When the eGBTS is disconnected or querying the license fails, the eGBTS license fails to be 
                                synchronized. 

                            l   When a disconnected eGBTS connects to the network again, the U2000 checks its license 
                                information. If the resource item value used by the eGBTS is not the same as that set on the U2000, 
                                the U2000 automatically synchronizes the eGBTS license.

6.5.3.9 Manually Downloading an eGBTS License 

                       This section describes how to manually download an eGBTS license to the U2000. When a 
                       BSC is now managed by another U2000, you can manually download an eGBTS license from 
                       the old U2000 and then upload it to the new U2000. In addition, you can manually download 
                       an eGBTS license to a local PC for query purposes.

6.5.3.10 Exporting eGBTS License Allocation Information 

                      This section describes how to export the eGBTS license allocation information. You can 
                      export the license allocation information about an eGBTS before reparenting the eGBTS to 
                      another BSC. In this way, you do not need to set license allocation information for the eGBTS 
                      again after it is reparented. Instead, you can directly import the previously exported license 
                      information to the eGBTS. During routine operation and maintenance, you can also export 
                      eGBTS license allocation information by BSC to facilitate data viewing and backup. 

Prerequisites 

                      You have allocated an eGBTS license to the eGBTS. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                      eGBTS (application style). The eGBTS License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2    In the navigation tree of the eGBTS License Management window, select a BSC node. The 
                      license information about this BSC is displayed in the right pane. 

            Step 3    Perform the following operations to export eGBTS license allocation information.

6.5.3.11 Importing eGBTS License Allocation Information 

                       This section describes how to import eGBTS license allocation information. When you 
                       reparent an eGBTS to another BSC or eGBTS license allocation information is missing, you 
                       do not need to set license allocation information for the eGBTS again after it is reparented. 
                       Instead, you can directly import the license information exported before the reparenting or 
                       exported in the NE License Data Export task in the Task Management window to the 
                       eGBTS.

                              NOTICE 

                    The total number of resources used by all the eGBTSs managed by a BSC cannot exceed the 
                    licensed value. Therefore, you must check the number of resources authorized in the eGBTS 
                    license of the target BSC before reparenting the eGBTS to this BSC. 

                    ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                    The eGBTS license allocation information does not take effect on the eGBTS immediately 
                     after the file is imported to the U2000. You need to deliver the information to the eGBTS for 
                    the information to take effect on the eGBTS. For detailed operations, see 6.5.3.5 Delivering 
                     eGBTS License Allocation Values. 

6.5.3.12 Revoking the eGBTS License 

                    This section describes how to revoke the eGBTS license. When the capacity specified in the 
                     eGBTS license, the ESN, or the telecom operator name needs to be changed, you need to 
                    update the eGBTS license. To do so, first revoke the current eGBTS license on your U2000 
                    client to obtain a revoked code. Then, send the revoked code to Huawei technical support to 
                     apply for a new eGBTS license. 

Prerequisites 

                     eGBTSs are properly connected to the U2000. 

Context 

                     l    After an activated eGBTS license is revoked, it enters a grace period of 60 days. 
                          Licensed resources and functions can be used during the grace period. After the grace 
                          period, the eGBTS license becomes invalid and only default resources and functions can 
                          be used. Therefore, you must upload the license and activate it within the grace period. 

                     l    After a deactivated eGBTS license is revoked, it cannot be activated again. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                    double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                     eGBTS (application style). The eGBTS License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2  Revoke the eGBTS license, as shown in Figure 6-24.

                             l   If you revoke a license repeatedly on the U2000, the system displays information indicating that this 
                                 license has been revoked and provides the revoked code. 

                             l   A normal eGBTS license enters a trial period after it is revoked. During the trial period, the U2000 
                                 generates the EVT-504 License Expiring event. After the trial period, the U2000 generates the 
                                 ALM-505 License Expired alarm.

Follow-up Procedure 

                        Contact Huawei technical support to apply for a new eGBTS license based on the revoked 
                        code. 

6.5.3.13 Deleting the eGBTS License 

                        This section describes how to delete an eGBTS license. In normal cases, you need to apply for 
                        a new eGBTS license if an eGBTS provides more functions or uses more resources after it is 
                        upgraded or its capacity is expanded. The new eGBTS license takes effect immediately after 
                        its allocation information is delivered to the eGBTS. The previous eGBTS license, which is 
                        deactivated accordingly, can be deleted. 

Prerequisites 

                        The eGBTS license to be deleted is deactivated.

Context 

                      Before you delete an active license, you need to activate another license by allocating and 
                      delivering this new license to the corresponding eGBTSs. Then the originally active license is 
                      automatically deactivated and can be deleted. For details about how to activate an eGBTS 
                      license by allocating and delivering it to eGBTSs, see 6.5.3.4 Modifying eGBTS License 
                      Allocation Values and 6.5.3.5 Delivering eGBTS License Allocation Values. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > eGBTS (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License >

6.5.3.14 Allocating Remaining eGBTS License Allocation Values to the BSC 
(Optional) 

                      This section describes how to allocate remaining eGBTS license allocation values to the BSC. 
                      In existing GSM networks, GBTSs and eGBTSs share the same eGBTS license after GBTSs 
                      are evolved into eGBTSs. In this case, you can allocate eGBTS license allocation values to 
                      eGBTSs by using the U2000 and allocate the remaining allocation values to the BSC. Then, 
                      the BSC delivers the remaining allocation values to GBTSs by using internal algorithms. 

Prerequisites 

                      The eGBTS license has contained both GBTS and eGBTS license control items.

                       eGBTS license management and provides the solutions. 

6.5.5.1 The U2000 Fails to Allocate Uploaded Licenses in BSC Pool Scenarios 

Symptom 

                       After the license of an eGBTS is uploaded to the U2000 in a BSC Pool scenario, the U2000 
                       fails to allocate the license. 

Possible Causes 

                       In BSC Pool scenarios, two BSCs that work in active/standby mode are configured for one 
                       eGBTS and both are displayed on the U2000. If the two BSCs have the same ESN, the U2000 
                       may incorrectly allocate the eGBTS license to the standby BSC, which causing an allocation 
                       failure.

Procedure 

             Step 1   Revoke the license allocated to the standby BSC, apply for a new license.

Related Information 

                      In BSC Pool scenarios, eGBTS licenses are managed as follows: 

                      l     In load sharing scenarios, two BSCs that work in active/standby mode have different 
                            ESNs and both are displayed on the U2000. The U2000 allocates the eGBTSs license to 
                            both the two BSCs. 

                      l     In BSC Pool scenarios, two BSCs that work in active/standby mode are both displayed 
                            on the U2000, and the eGBTS is mounted to the active BSC. The U2000 needs to 
                            allocate the eGBTS license only to the active BSC. 

                               NOTE 

                            if the two BSCs have the same ESN, the U2000 may incorrectly allocate the eGBTs license to the 
                            standby BSC. If this problem occurs, revoke the license allocated to the standby BSC, apply for a new 
                            license, and upload the new license to the active BSC. 

6.6 NodeB License Management 

                      This section describes NodeB license management. The NodeB license defines the functions 
                      and resources available for the NodeBs under an RNC or in a co-MPT base station involving 
                      the UMTS technology in normal cases. The U2000 provides NodeB license management 
                      functions, such as uploading, allocation, synchronization, importing, and exporting. 

6.6.1 Overview of the NodeB License 

                      This section describes the management, validity, and automatic verification of NodeB 
                      licenses. 

6.6.1.1 NodeB License Management 

                      This section describes the management of NodeB licenses. NodeB licenses are issued by 
                      Huawei and are centrally managed on the U2000. 

Classification of NodeB Licenses 

                      The NodeB license is classified into the following types: 

                      l     Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After a 
                            user has purchased a commercial license, the NodeBs of this user can use all resources 
                            and provide all functions within a time period specified in the commercial license. 

                      l     Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei directly and do not need to pay 
                            for them. After a user has obtained a trial license, the NodeBs of this user can use trial 
                            resources and provide trial functions within a time period specified in the trial license. 
                            The default validity period of a trial license is three months.

Management of NodeB Licenses 

                      The U2000 centrally manages NodeB licenses. For details, see Figure 6-28. 

                      Figure 6-28 Managing NodeB licenses 

                        

                       l    A NodeB license is generated based on the equipment serial number (ESN) of an RNC, 
                            and is shared by all NodeBs managed by this RNC. 

                       l    NodeB license files are saved on the U2000 server instead of on NodeBs. The U2000 
                            allocates NodeB licenses and delivers them to NodeBs for the licenses to take effect. 

                       l    The total number of resources allocated to all NodeBs managed by an RAN cannot 
                            exceed the number of resources specified in the corresponding NodeB license. In 
                            addition, the resources of one RNC cannot be allocated to the NodeBs managed by 
                            another RNC. 

                       l    NodeBs displayed on the NodeB License Management window are all obtained from the 
                            main topology. 

Scenarios in Which You Need to Apply for a License 

                       l    An RNC is newly deployed. 

                       l    The RNC ESN is changed. 

                       l    The capacity and functions of a NodeB are expanded after this NodeB is upgraded or 
                            expanded. 

                            The license for a new NodeB version includes all functions and resources authorized by 
                            the license for an earlier NodeB version. Therefore, a NodeB can still provide all existing 
                            functions and use all existing resources after it is upgraded. 

                       l    A NodeB is reparented. 

6.6.1.2 NodeB License Validity and Automatic Verification 

                      This section describes the NodeB license validity, processing mechanism for exceeded NodeB 
                      license allocation values, and automatic verification of NodeB licenses.

NodeB License Validity 

                       If the equipment identification information matches the ESN in the NodeB license and the 
                       NodeB license has not expired, the license file is valid. Otherwise, the license file is invalid. 
                       The following two methods are used to process valid and invalid license files: 

                       If the license file is invalid: 

                        l    The U2000 generates the ALM-501 License Invalid alarm. 

                       If the license file is valid: 

                        l    If the license is within 30 days before the validity period, the U2000 generates an 
                             EVT-503 License To Be On Trial event. 

                        l    The license enters a 60-day grace period after it expires. The license remains valid 
                             during the grace period and becomes invalid after the grace period. After the license 
                             becomes invalid, NodeBs in the RAN can use only the default resources and provide 
                             only the default functions. 

                        l    The U2000 generates the EVT-504 License Expiring event and ALM-506 License On 
                             Trial alarm during the 60-day grace period after the license expires. 

                        l    The U2000 generates the ALM-505 License Expired alarm after the 60-day grace 
                             period. 

Processing Mechanism for Exceeded NodeB License Allocation Values 

                       The license allocation value exceeds the limit when the assigned license allocation value is 
                       greater than the authorized allocation value of the NodeB license. This happens when a 
                       NodeB newly accesses the U2000 and the initial license allocation value of the NodeB plus 
                       the license values already assigned to the existing NodeBs are greater than the authorized 
                        allocation value of the NodeB license. 

                       If a newly admitted NodeB has the initial license allocation value but the U2000 does not 
                       have the license allocation value for this NodeB, the processing mechanism for exceeded 
                       NodeB license values is as follows: 

                        1.    If the NodeB license value does not exceed the limit after the U2000 is upgraded, the 
                             U2000 assigns its remaining value of the NodeB license or the initial license allocation 
                             value (whichever is less) to the NodeB. 

                                 NOTE 

                                  If the remaining value of the NodeB license on the U2000 is less than the initial license allocation 
                                  value on the NodeB, the U2000 generates the ALM-527 License Value Automatically Assigned 
                                  by the U2000 to the Base Station Less Than the Initial License Value of the Base Station 
                                  alarm. 

                       2.    If the NodeB license value exceeds the limit after the U2000 is upgraded, the following 
                             processing applies: 

                              –    For a NodeB that accesses the U2000 within 60 days after the NodeB license value 
                                   exceeds the limit (after the U2000 upgrade), the processing mechanism is the same 
                                   as that described in 1. 

                              –    For a NodeB that accesses the U2000 60 days after the NodeB license value 
                                   exceeds the limit, the U2000 clears the initial license allocation value on the 
                                   NodeB. 

                       Whether the number of resources allocated to the NodeBs in an RAN exceeds the threshold 
                        specified in the license: If excessive resources are allocated, the U2000 generates the 
                       ALM-526 Excessive License Usage alarm.

NodeB License Automatic Verification 

                        The U2000 automatically checks the validity period of a NodeB license, whether the license 
                        information saved on the U2000 is the same as that saved on NodeBs, and whether the 
                        number of resources allocated to NodeBs exceeds the threshold specified in the license. 

                        The U2000 checks the following items to verify the validity of the license on a daily basis: 

                        l     Whether the NodeB license has expired: If the license has expired, the U2000 generates 
                              the ALM-505 License Expired alarm. 

                        l     Whether the license information delivered to NodeBs is consistent with that saved on the 
                             U2000: If the information is inconsistent, the following message is displayed on the 
                             U2000, as shown in Figure 6-29:

                                 NOTE 

                                   The U2000 checks the validity of the license every day. If the number of resources allocated to the 
                                   NodeBs is consistent with that saved on the U2000, Synchronize is Yes. Otherwise, Synchronize 
                                   is No. 

                                   The number of resources allocated to the NodeBs is inconsistent with that saved in the U2000 in 
                                   the following scenarios: 

                                   l     The NodeB is not connected to the U2000 or the U2000 does not allocate the license to the 
                                         NodeB. 

                                   l     When the NodeB is disconnected or querying the license fails, the status of Synchronize is 
                                         not updated. 

                                   l     The U2000 allocates a license to the NodeB but the NodeB returns a failure message or does 
                                         not return a message in time.

                              The license for a new NodeB version includes all functions and resources authorized by the license for 
                              an earlier NodeB version. Therefore, a NodeB can still provide all existing functions and use all existing 
                              resources after it is upgraded. 

6.6.2.5 Scenario: Expanding the Capacity of a NodeB 

                        This section describes how to apply for a new NodeB license if the existing license capacity 
                        of a NodeB whose functions or resources are expanded is insufficient. 

                        Figure 6-34 shows the NodeB license operation process when the capacity of a NodeB is 
                        expanded.

6.6.2.6 Scenario: Reparenting a NodeB 

                        This section describes how to export the license allocation values specified in the license of a 
                        NodeB from its source RNC and then import the values to its target RNC when this NodeB is 
                        reparented to another RNC. 

                        Figure 6-35 shows the NodeB license operation process when a NodeB is reparented. 

                            NOTE 

                             When a NodeB is relocated within the same RNC, the NodeB license allocation values are not affected, 
                             and therefore you do not need to perform any operation.

6.6.3 Common Operations on the NodeB License 

                      This chapter describes common operations on the NodeB license. 

6.6.3.1 Querying the ESN of an RNC 

                      This section describes how to query the equipment serial number (ESN) of an RNC. NodeBs 
                     managed by the same RNC share one NodeB license. You must obtain the ESN of the RNC 
                     before applying for the NodeB license. 

Prerequisites 

                      l    The connection between an RNC and the U2000 is proper. 

                      l    The ESN of the RNC has been reported to the U2000. 

Context 

                      The Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), and ID of an RNC are 
                      sequenced and encrypted to form the ESN of the RNC. In the RAN sharing scenario and 
                      certain multi-operator core network (MOCN) scenarios, the RAN is shared by multiple 
                     telecom operators. The RNC in the RAN may have multiple ESNs. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                      NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2    Query the ESN of an RNC, as shown in Figure 6-36. 

                      Figure 6-36 Querying the ESN of an RNC 

                       

                      The RNC ESN information varies according to scenarios, as described in Table 6-11.

                          NOTE 

                            When you apply for a NodeB license, you need to obtain the ESN of the RNC of the primary telecom 
                            operator. 

                       ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                       Contact Huawei technical support to apply for a NodeB license for the RAN based on the 
                       queried ESN. 

                          NOTE 

                            You can copy the ESN information on the GUI. 

6.6.3.2 Uploading a NodeB License File to the U2000 Server 

                       This section describes how to upload a NodeB license file to the U2000 server. NodeBs do 
                       not store license information. Therefore, all license-related operations are performed on the 
                       U2000. After obtaining a NodeB license file, you need to upload it to the U2000 server, and 
                       then allocate the license to NodeBs through the U2000 client. 

Prerequisites 

                       You have obtained a valid NodeB license file. 

Context 

                       In the RAN sharing scenario and certain MOCN scenarios, the RNC in the RAN may have 
                       multiple ESNs. In this case, the ESN of the NodeB license must be consistent with the ESN 
                       corresponding to the primary telecom operator. If the ESNs are inconsistent, the U2000 
                       generates the ALM-502 License Not Match alarm. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                       double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                       NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2    Upload NodeB license files, as shown in Figure 6-37.

                            NOTE 

                             l     You can upload multiple NodeB license files for one RNC. Only one license is active at a time. 

                             l     System time refers to the time on the U2000 server rather than the time on the U2000 client. 

                             l     If a license file fails to be uploaded, you can view the cause of the failure in upload logs. 

             Step 3     After the NodeB license files are uploaded to the U2000, you can double-click a license file to 
                        view details. For details about the parameters, see 6.6.4.2 Parameters for NodeB License 
                        Information.

6.6.3.3 Setting Thresholds for Allocating NodeB License Resources (Optional) 

                        This section describes how to set thresholds for allocating NodeB license resources. You can 
                        set a threshold for the ratio of allocated resources to authorized resources. When the ratio 
                        exceeds the threshold, the U2000 generates the ALM-519 The Proportion of Distributed 
                        License Is Too High alarm. This alarm alerts you to the situation that excess resources are 
                        allocated in real time. 

Context 

                        Setting license allocation thresholds is disabled by default. You can enable this function and 
                        set specific thresholds on the U2000 client. If you do not need to observe license resource 
                        allocation ratios, disable this function to prevent the U2000 from generating unnecessary 
                        alarms.

                     This section describes how to allocate a license to telecom operators. When telecom operators 
                     share one RAN, they can also share the resources defined in a NodeB license after you 
                     allocate the license to the telecom operators. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    RAN sharing is configured in RNC configuration data. 

                     l    Information about multiple telecom operators is configured in RNC configuration data. 

                     l    You have uploaded a valid NodeB license file to the U2000 server. 

Context 

                     l    In scenarios where multiple telecom operators share one RAN, telecom operators can 
                          share one license and the license can be allocated to telecom operators. 

                     l    In scenarios where the multi-operator core network (MOCN) supports baseband resource 
                          separation, telecom operators can share one license and the license can be allocated to 
                          telecom operators. 

                     l    In other scenarios, multiple telecom operators cannot share a license and licenses can be 
                          allocated to telecom operators. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                     double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                     NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2   Allocate a license to telecom operators, as shown in Figure 6-39.

                        NodeB license allocation values, you need to deliver NodeB license allocation values to a 
                        NodeB for them to take effect. 

Prerequisites 

                        You have modified NodeB license allocation values.

                             NOTE 

                              l   After the U2000 allocates a license to an unknown NodeB, an error message is displayed. After you 
                                  have planned the model and version for the NodeB and the NodeB is physically connected to the 
                                  U2000, the U2000 automatically delivers the license that is allocated to the NodeB in advance. 

                              l   If the U2000 is disconnected from a NodeB when delivering the license allocation information to the 
                                  NodeB, the U2000 saves the license allocation information. Once the connection restores, the U2000 
                                  delivers the saved license allocation information again to the NodeB. 

                              l   When the U2000 allocates a license to the NodeB but the NodeB returns a failure message or does 
                                  not return a message in time, the NodeB license fails to be synchronized. 

                         ----End 

Result 

                         Before the U2000 delivers a license to a NodeB, the U2000 delivers a message to the NodeB 
                         and queries the NodeB license. If the queried license is not the same as that to be delivered on 
                         the U2000, the latter prevails. The U2000 will deliver full license allocation values. 

                             NOTE 

                              After a U2000 upgrade or license capacity expansion, the license control items delivered to NodeBs are 
                              still valid. 

                         If the total number of resources used by NodeBs exceeds the threshold specified in the license 
                        because the resources are not correctly planned or set, the license resource allocation fails. In 
                         addition, the U2000 generates the ALM-526 Excessive License Usage alarm. You need to 
                         reset the license resources used by NodeBs and allocate the license again. 

                         If the values of resource control items used by NodeBs are not the same as the corresponding 
                         values set on the U2000, resulting from license allocation failure or other reasons, you need to 
                         synchronize the license allocation information saved on the U2000 to the NodeBs. For 
                         detailed operations, see 6.6.3.9 Synchronizing a NodeB License.

6.6.3.7 Viewing NodeB License Details 

                    This section describes how to view the attributes of the current license of a specified RNC and 
                    the license allocation information on the U2000 client. 

Prerequisites 

                    l    You have uploaded a valid NodeB license file to the U2000 server. 

                    l    You have allocated a NodeB license to telecom operators when they share the same 
                         RAN. 

Context 

                    l    For a resource control item in a NodeB license, you can set different values for the 
                         NodeBs managed by the RNC. The sum of the values, however, must be less than the 
                         maximum value specified in the license. For example, if the license information contains 
                         LQW9ULCE01=128, the sum of UL CE values for all the NodeBs managed by the 
                         RNC must be less than 128. 

                    l    You can manually modify NodeB license allocation information. 

Procedure 

           Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                    double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                    NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

           Step 2   View NodeB license details, as shown in Figure 6-43.

6.6.3.9 Synchronizing a NodeB License 

                        This section describes how to synchronize a NodeB license. The resource control item values 
                        on a NodeB may be not the same as the corresponding values on the U2000 server if the 
                        NodeB is in maintenance, the NodeB file system is damaged, or the NodeB license file is 
                        deleted. You can synchronize the license allocation information on the NodeB with that on the 
                        U2000. The U2000 automatically delivers NodeB license allocation information to NodeBs 
                        on a scheduled basis every day. You can also manually synchronize the NodeB license 
                        allocation information to NodeBs. 

Prerequisites 

                        The NodeB license to be synchronized is active. 

Procedure 

             Step 1     Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                        double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                        NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2     Synchronize a NodeB license, as shown in Figure 6-44.

                        During license synchronization, the U2000 checks whether the information reported by 
                        NodeBs is consistent with the information saved on the U2000 server.

                       l    If the total number of resources used by all the NodeBs in the current RAN exceeds the 
                            number of resources authorized by the NodeB license, the U2000 reports the ALM-526 
                            Excessive License Usage alarm. 

                       l    If the resource control item values used by NodeBs are not the same as the 
                            corresponding values set on the U2000, You can manually synchronize the NodeB 
                            license allocation information to NodeBs. 

                          NOTE 

                            l  When the NodeB is disconnected or querying the license fails, the NodeB license fails to be 
                               synchronized. 

                            l  When a disconnected NodeB connects to the network again, the U2000 checks its license 
                               information. If the resource item value used by the NodeB is not the same as that set on the U2000, 
                               the U2000 automatically synchronizes the NodeB license.

6.6.3.10 Manually Downloading a NodeB License 

                      This section describes how to manually download a NodeB license on the U2000. When a 
                      RAN system is reparented between U2000 systems, you can manually download a NodeB 
                      license from the old U2000, and then upload it to the new U2000. In addition, you can 
                      manually download a NodeB license to a local PC. 

Prerequisites 

                      A NodeB license has been uploaded to an U2000 server. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                      double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                      NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed.

6.6.3.11 Exporting NodeB License Allocation Information 

                       You can export the license allocation information about a NodeB to a file before reparenting 
                       the NodeB to another RNC. In this way, you do not need to set license allocation information 
                       for the NodeB again after it is reparented. Instead, you can directly import the previously 
                       exported license information to the NodeB without performing more operations. During 
                       routine operation and maintenance, you can also export NodeB license allocation information 
                       by RAN to facilitate data viewing and backup. 

Prerequisites 

                       NodeB license allocation information is delivered to NodeBs. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                       double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License >

6.6.3.12 Importing NodeB License Allocation Information 

                     This section describes how to import NodeB license allocation information. When you 
                     reparent an NodeB to another RNC or NodeB license allocation information is missing, you 
                     do not need to set license allocation information for the NodeB again after it is reparented. 
                     Instead, you can directly import the license information exported before the reparenting or 
                     exported in the NE License Data Export task in the Task Management window to the 
                     NodeB. This function improves work efficiency. 

Prerequisites 

                     The license allocation information about a NodeB to be reparented is exported. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                     double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                     NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2   Perform the following operations to back up NodeB license allocation information. 

                     1.    Click     . 

                     2.   Select the RNC managing the NodeB whose license allocation information needs to be 
                           imported. 

                     3.    Specify a local path and file name for saving the license allocation information. 

                     4.   Click OK. 

            Step 3   Import NodeB license allocation information, as shown in Figure 6-46.

                       The total number of resources used by all the NodeBs managed by an RNC cannot exceed the 
                       number of resources authorized by the NodeB license of the RNC. Therefore, before 
                       reparenting a NodeB to another RNC, you need to check the number of resources authorized 
                       in the NodeB license of the target RNC.

Follow-up Procedure 

                     The NodeB license allocation information does not take effect on the NodeB immediately 
                     after the file is imported to the U2000. You need to deliver the information to the NodeB for 
                    the information to take effect on the NodeB. For detailed operations, see 6.6.3.5 Modifying 
                    NodeB License Allocation Values. 

6.6.3.13 Revoking a Normal NodeB License 

                     This section describes how to update a NodeB license when the capacity specified in the 
                    NodeB license, the ESN, or the telecom operator name needs to be changed. You can revoke 
                    the current NodeB license on your U2000 client to obtain a revoked code, and then send the 
                    revoked code to Huawei technical support engineers who will help you apply for a new 
                    NodeB license. This function helps you obtain a new NodeB license quickly. 

Prerequisites 

                    NEs are properly connected to the U2000. 

Context 

                     l    After an activated NodeB license is revoked, it enters a grace period of 60 days. 
                          Licensed resources and functions can be used during the grace period. After the grace 
                          period, the NodeB license becomes invalid and only default resources and functions can 
                          be used. Therefore, you must upload the license and activate it within the grace period. 

                     l    After a deactivated NodeB license is revoked, it cannot be activated again. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                     double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                    NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed.

6.6.3.14 Deleting a NodeB License 

                        This section describes how to delete a NodeB license. In normal cases, you need to apply for a 
                        new NodeB license if a NodeB provides more functions or use more resources after it is 
                        upgraded or its capacity is expanded. The new NodeB license takes effect immediately after 
                        its allocation information is delivered to the NodeB. The previous NodeB license, which is 
                        deactivated accordingly, can be deleted. 

Prerequisites 

                        The NodeB license to be deleted is inactive.

                      information. 

Context 

                      In the multioperator sharing scenario, when all cells of a NodeB of a private operator are 
                      deleted from an RNC, the corresponding allocation value of all the cells of the NodeB on the 
                      U2000 is not deleted, thereby becoming redundant. The redundant allocation value is marked 
                      as gray and can be manually recycled. 

                      Only activated licenses support recycling redundant allocation value.

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > NodeB (traditional style); alternatively, 
                     double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                     NodeB (application style). The NodeB License Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2   Select the license allocation information in gray, right-click it, and then choose Recycle from 
                     the shortcut menu. 

            Step 3   In the displayed Confirm dialog box, click OK. 

                         NOTE 

                          When the U2000 recycles the license allocation information, if NEs are disconnected from the U2000, 
                          the U2000 finishes recycling operations on the U2000. After reconnecting to the U2000, NEs perform 
                          automatic recycling operations.

Symptom 

                    In RAN sharing scenarios, the NodeB can not be found under the private operator. 

Possible Causes 

                    The NodeBID configured on the RNC/BSC is inconsistent with NodeB ID on the U2000. 

Procedure 

           Step 1   Run the LST UOPERATORSHARINGMODE command on the RNC/BSC to check 
                    whether the RNC/BSC supports RAN sharing. If it does not, contact Huawei Technical 
                    support to modify the configuration. 

           Step 2   Run the LST UCNOPERGROUP command on the RNC/BSC to query the operator group 
                    and the main operator configured on the RNC/BSC. 

           Step 3   Run the LST UCELL command on the RNC/BSC to check whether the operator group has 
                    been configured on the NodeB in the displayed information, the displayed information is 
                    similar to Figure 6-50. If the operator group is not configured, contact Huawei technical 
                    support to modify the configuration.

6.7 WiMAX BTS License Management (Excluding 
BTS3701B Licenses) 

                     A WiMAX BTS license defines the functions and resources available to the WiMAX BTSs 
                     with identical version and release (in VxxxRxxx format) in a U2000 system. You can manage 
                     WiMAX BTS licenses on the U2000, such as uploading, allocating, synchronizing, and 
                     querying licenses. 

Context 

                     The U2000 can manage the licenses of the BTS3702C, BTS3702E, and DBS3900 WiMAX. 

6.7.1 Overview of the WiMAX BTS License 

                     WiMAX BTS licenses are provided by suppliers to telecom operators for governing the usage 
                     and redistribution of WiMAX BTSs. They are centrally saved and managed in the U2000 
                     system. WiMAX BTSs with identical version and release (in VxxxRxxx format) share one 
                     license. 

Classification of WiMAX BTS Licenses 

                     The WiMAX BTS license is classified into the following types: 

                     l    Commercial license: Users need to purchase commercial licenses from Huawei. After a 
                          user has purchased a commercial license, the WiMAX BTSs of this user can use all 
                          resources and provide all functions within a time period specified in the commercial 
                          license. 

                     l    Trial license: Users can obtain trial licenses from Huawei directly and do not need to pay 
                          for them. After a user has obtained a trial license, the WiMAX BTSs of this user can use 
                          trial resources and provide trial functions within a time period specified in the trial 
                          license. The default validity period of a trial license is three months. 

Management of WiMAX BTS Licenses 

                     The U2000 uniformly manages WiMAX BTS licenses, as shown in Figure 6-51.

                      Figure 6-51 WiMAX BTS license management 

                        
                      The mechanism for managing WiMAX BTSs is described as follows: 

                      l     Based on the ESN of a U2000 system, a WiMAX BTS license is generated and shared by 
                            all the WiMAX BTSs with identical version and release in the U2000 system. 

                      l     WiMAX BTS license files are saved on the U2000 server, not on WiMAX BTS devices. 
                            WiMAX BTS licenses are allocated to WiMAX BTSs through the U2000. After the 
                            U2000 delivers license allocation information to WiMAX BTSs, the information takes 
                            effect immediately. 

                      l     The total number of resources allocated to the WiMAX BTSs with identical version and 
                            release cannot exceed the number of resources authorized by the corresponding WiMAX 
                            BTS license. 

Scenarios in Which You Need to Apply for a License 

                      Telecom operators need to apply for a WiMAX BTS license in the following scenarios: 

                      l     A WiMAX BTS is created but a license corresponding to the WiMAX BTS version is 
                            unavailable. 

                      l     A WiMAX BTS cross-version or cross-release upgrade is required. 

                      l     The existing WiMAX BTS license has insufficient capacity and a capacity expansion is 
                            required. 

6.7.2 WiMAX BTS License Operation Process 

                      This section describes the process of managing a WiMAX BTS license on the U2000. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Query the ESN of the U2000 system. 

                      The MAC address of an U2000 server is encrypted to form the Equipment Serial Number 
                      (ESN) of the U2000 system. For detailed operations, see 6.7.2.1 Querying the ESN of an 
                      U2000 System. 

             Step 2   Upload the WiMAX BTS license file to the U2000 server. 

                      You need to perform all license-related operations through the U2000 because WiMAX BTS 
                      license files are not saved on WiMAX BTS devices. After obtaining a WiMAX BTS license, 
                      you need to upload the license file to the U2000 server, and then perform license-related

                    operations (for example, license allocation) on the WiMAX BTSs through the U2000 client. 
                    For detailed operations, see 6.7.2.2 Uploading a WiMAX BTS License File to the U2000 
                    Server. 

           Step 3   Allocate the WiMAX BTS license. 

                    After uploading a WiMAX BTS license file to the U2000 server, you need to allocate the 
                    license to the WiMAX BTSs. Then you can activate the license for it to take effect. For 
                    detailed operations, see 6.7.2.3 Allocating a WiMAX BTS License. 

           Step 4   View the WiMAX BTS license allocation information. 

                    Through the U2000 client, you can view the currently activated license file corresponding to a 
                    specified WiMAX BTS version and the license allocation information about all the WiMAX 
                    BTSs in the U2000 system. For detailed operations, see 6.7.2.4 Viewing WiMAX BTS 
                    License Allocation Information. 

           Step 5   Optional: Synchronize the WiMAX BTS license. 

                    The resource control item values saved on a WiMAX BTS may be inconsistent with the 
                    corresponding values saved on the U2000 if the WiMAX BTS is maintained, the WiMAX 
                    BTS file system is damaged, or the WiMAX BTS license is deleted. In this case, you can 
                    synchronize the license allocation information saved on the WiMAX BTS with that saved on 
                    the U2000. The U2000 automatically delivers WiMAX BTS license allocation information to 
                    WiMAX BTSs on a scheduled basis every day. For detailed operations, see 6.7.2.5 
                    Synchronizing a WiMAX BTS License. 

           Step 6   Optional: Delete the WiMAX BTS license. 

                    A WiMAX BTS can provide more functions or use more resources after it is upgraded or its 
                    capacity is expanded. Generally, you need to apply for a new WiMAX BTS license before 
                    performing a WiMAX BTS upgrade or capacity expansion. The new WiMAX BTS license 
                    takes effect immediately after its allocation information is delivered to the WiMAX BTS. The 
                    previous WiMAX BTS license, which is deactivated accordingly, can be deleted. For detailed 
                    operations, see 6.7.2.7 Deleting a WiMAX BTS License.

                      l    If the ESN recorded in a WiMAX BTS license file is inconsistent with that recorded in 
                           the U2000 system or the license file has been modified, the license is regarded as invalid. 

                      l    You can upload multiple WiMAX BTS license files to the U2000 server. After you 
                           upload a WiMAX BTS license file to the U2000 server, the license is in inactive state by 
                           default. 

                           If a WiMAX BTS license is active, the license is in use. Only one WiMAX BTS license 
                           can be activated for the WiMAX BTSs with a certain version and release. 

Procedure

6.7.2.3 Allocating a WiMAX BTS License 

                      After uploading a WiMAX BTS license file to the U2000 server, you need to allocate the 
                      license to the WiMAX BTSs. Then you can activate the license for it to take effect. 

Prerequisites 

                      The WiMAX BTS license file corresponding to the WiMAX BTS version has been uploaded 
                      to the U2000 server. 

Context 

                      l     After you upload a WiMAX BTS license file to the U2000 server, the license is in 
                            inactive state. Therefore, you need to allocate the license to WiMAX BTSs for it to take 
                            effect. 

                      l     Multiple WiMAX BTS license files can exist in a U2000 system, but only one WiMAX 
                            BTS license can be activated for the WiMAX BTSs with a certain version and release. 

                      l     The total number of resources allocated to the WiMAX BTSs with identical version and 
                            release cannot exceed the number of resources authorized by the corresponding WiMAX 
                            BTS license. Otherwise, resources cannot be allocated. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose License > NE License Management > WiMAX BTS (traditional style); 
                      alternatively, double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE 
                      License > WiMAX BTS (application style). The WiMAX BTS Network License 
                      Management window is displayed. 

             Step 2   In the navigation tree in the left pane, select a version node. 

                      The WiMAX BTSs earlier than V300R003 cannot be sorted by version number and are all 
                      displayed under the Default node. 

             Step 3   In the license information area, select a WiMAX BTS license. 

                      The number of resources authorized by the license is displayed in the license allocation area. 

                      For example,                                  indicates that the number of authorized resources is 
                      400,000,000 and three of them are being used.

6.7.2.5 Synchronizing a WiMAX BTS License 

                      The resource control item values saved on a WiMAX BTS may be inconsistent with the 
                      corresponding values saved on the U2000 if the WiMAX BTS is maintained, the WiMAX 
                      BTS file system is damaged, or the WiMAX BTS license is deleted. In this case, you can 
                      synchronize the license allocation information saved on the WiMAX BTS with that saved on 
                      the U2000. The U2000 automatically delivers WiMAX BTS license allocation information to 
                      WiMAX BTSs on a scheduled basis every day. 

Prerequisites 

                      The WiMAX BTS license to be synchronized is active. 

Procedure 

            Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > WiMAX BTS (traditional style); 
                      alternatively, double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE

                      Management window is displayed. 

            Step 2    In the navigation tree in the left pane, select a version node. 
                      The WiMAX BTSs earlier than V300R003 cannot be sorted by version number and are all 
                      displayed under the Default node. 

            Step 3    In the license information area, right-click the WiMAX BTS license to be synchronized, and 
                      then choose Synchronize to NE from the shortcut menu. 
                      You must select an active WiMAX BTS license. After an inactive license is allocated to 
                      WiMAX BTSs through the U2000 client, the license is activated automatically. 

                      ----End 

6.7.2.6 Invalidating WiMAX Licenses 

                      A new NE license is required when you adjust the capacity or change the Equipment Serial 
                      Number (ESN) or telecom operator of an NE. On the U2000 client, you can invalidate a 
                      currently active NE license and obtain an invalidation code. Then you can use the invalidation 
                      code to apply for a new license quickly. In this way, you can apply for a new license more 
                      efficiently. 

Prerequisites 

                      l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                      l    The U2000 and related NEs communicate properly. 

                      l    You are authorized to perform operations on NE licenses. 

Context 

                      l    If an NE license is invalidated, it switches to the grace state. The grace state lasts for 60 
                           days.

                       l     After an NE license expires, it switches to the grace state. When the NE license is in this 
                             state, all control items specified in the NE license are still available but you can apply for 
                             a new license. When the grace period ends, the license expires and can no longer be 
                             used. 

                       l     If no NE license exists, the existing NE license is incorrect, or the existing NE license 
                             exceeds both the validity period and grace period, the NE license is in No valid license 
                             file state. The NE whose license is in No valid license file state cannot be used. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > WiMAX BTS (traditional style); 
                       alternatively, double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE 
                       License > WiMAX BTS (application style). The WiMAX License Management window is 
                       displayed. 

             Step 2    Select an NE version node from the navigation tree in the left pane. 

                       The operators and licenses related to the RAN are displayed in two tables in the upper right 
                       part of the window. 

             Step 3    Right-click the license that you want to invalidate and choose Revoke from the shortcut 
                       menu. 

             Step 4    Click Yes to invalidate the license. 

                       After the license is invalidated, a dialog box is displayed showing the time when the license is 
                       invalidated and the invalidation code, or you can double-click a license that has been 
                       invalidated to view the time when the license is invalidated and the invalidation code. 

                           NOTE 

                       l   If you run MML commands to re-invalidate a license after the license has been invalidated, the re- 
                           invalidation fails. 

                       l   If you re-invalidate a license on U2000, the U2000 displays a message showing the re-invalidation is 
                           successful. However, this message actually is the successful invalidation message displayed in the first 
                           time when the license was invalidated, which does not represent the real result of the re-invalidation. 

                       ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                       You can log in to FNO WEB and apply for a new license using the invalidation code. 

6.7.2.7 Deleting a WiMAX BTS License 

                       A WiMAX BTS can provide more functions or use more resources after it is upgraded or its 
                       capacity is expanded. Generally, you need to apply for a new WiMAX BTS license before 
                       performing a WiMAX BTS upgrade or capacity expansion. The new WiMAX BTS license 
                       takes effect immediately after its allocation information is delivered to the WiMAX BTS. The 
                       previous WiMAX BTS license, which is deactivated accordingly, can be deleted. 

Prerequisites 

                       The WiMAX BTS license to be deleted is inactive.

                           to the corresponding WiMAX BTSs first. Then the originally active license is automatically deactivated 
                           and can be deleted. For details about how to activate a WiMAX BTS license by allocating it to WiMAX 
                           BTSs, see 6.7.2.3 Allocating a WiMAX BTS License.

                      A license can function only when it is activated. Once a license is loaded on an eCoordinator, 
                      it is inactive by default, and you need to manually activate the license. 

Prerequisites 

                      The license has been loaded on the eCoordinator. 

Procedure 

             Step 1   Choose Choose Software > Software Browser (traditional style); alternatively, double-click 
                      Software Management in Application Center and choose NE File > Software Browser 
                      (application style).. The Software Browser window is displayed. 

             Step 2   Click the NE tab. Expand NE > ECO6910 and select an eCoordinator. 

             Step 3   Click the License tab in the right pane. 
                      The tab page displays information about the license loaded on the eCoordinator. 

             Step 4   Select a license to be activated and click Activate. The Activate License File window is 
                      displayed. 

             Step 5   Click OK. 

                      During activation, the eCoordinator verifies this license file. The verification involves the 
                      following aspects: 

                      l     File validity verification: verifies that the license file matches the eCoordinator, is not 
                            corrupted, and does not expire. If the license file is invalid, the activation fails. 

                      l     Authorization resource value verification: verifies that the total number of resources used 
                            by the eCoordinator is less than or equal to the number of resources authorized by the 
                            license file. If the number of used resources exceeds the number of authorized resources, 
                            the activation fails. 

                      l     ESN verification: verifies that the ESN of the license file is consistent with the ESN of 
                            the eCoordinator. If the ESNs are inconsistent, the license file can still be activated, but 
                            will enter the trial period.

                       the license. The license controls the validity period or functions of an NE. Therefore, you 
                       need to view the license state and change the expired license. Otherwise, services will be 
                       affected. 

6.9.1 Getting to Know Stand-Alone License 

                       This topic describes the scenarios of the stand-alone license management, which helps you to 
                       understand the procedure for managing stand-alone licenses in different scenarios. By 
                       viewing Stand-Alone License states, you can judge whether licenses meet service 
                       requirements. 

Stand-Alone License Operation Scenarios 

                       When you apply for a stand-alone license, you can query, install, and change the stand-alone 
                       license. You can also change the capacities defined in the stand-alone license. 

Stand-Alone License States 

                       A stand-alone license has six states. Table 6-17 shows the stand-alone license states. 

                       Table 6-17 stand-alone license states 

                         State                    Description 

                         Default                  If the NE license state is Default, all the NE functions are in the 
                                                  Default state, and eNodeB is running with the allowed least resources 
                                                  and functions. 

                         Commissioning            If a stand-alone license that you apply for during NE commissioning, 
                                                  the license is in debugging state. In this state, you can use NE 
                                                  functions in a certain period. However, if the license expires, you 
                                                  cannot use the functions. Therefore, you need to apply for a 
                                                  commercial license before the license expires. 

                         Normal                   When the stand-alone license obtained from a commercial contract is 
                                                  used, this license is in the Normal use state. In this state, you can use 
                                                  the resources and functions in the stand-alone license. 

                         Grace Period             After a stand-alone license expires, it has a grace period. In this 
                                                  period, you can apply for a new license. In the grace period, all 
                                                  control items in the stand-alone license are available. 

                         Emergency                In emergent situations such as a disaster, the stand-alone license state 
                                                  can be set to Emergency. In this state, the stand-alone license control 
                                                  is cancelled, and the device capacity is set to the maximum. This 
                                                  prevents the NE services from being damaged. 

                                                  NOTE 
                                                    If a stand-alone license is in the Critical state, contact Huawei technical

                                                  functions defined in a stand-alone license. The cause for this state is 
                                                  that verification of the correctness of the stand-alone license file fails. 
                                                  In this case, the stand-alone license keeps valid for 60 days (keep-

6.9.2 Process of Managing the Stand-Alone License 

                        This section describes the process of managing the stand-alone licenseon the U2000. 

Procedure 

             Step 1     Query the stand-alone license state. 

                        This section describes how to query the license state of an NE and provides handling 
                        suggestions. For details, see 6.9.2.1 Querying the Stand-Alone License Information. 

             Step 2    Export the information for applying for the stand-alone license. 

                        This topic describes how to apply for a stand-alone license. When you install an NE, you need 
                       to export the NE application information to apply for a stand-alone license, ensuring that NE 
                        functions are used properly. For details, see 6.9.2.2 Applying for a Stand-Alone License. 

             Step 3     Checking the Mapping Between stand-alone license and NEs 

                        This topic describes the procedure to check whether a stand-alone license is mapped properly 
                       with the NE configuration data before loading and issue the license file to the NE for 
                        installation. For details, see 6.9.2.3 Checking the Mapping Between Stand-Alone License 
                        and NEs. 

             Step 4     Install the stand-alone license. 

                        This section describes how to load a license file for an NE present in the network. The 
                        supported functions run properly only after you install a valid license for an NE. After you 
                        successfully load a license for an NE, the license file is backed up in the U2000 server. For 
                        details, see 6.9.2.4 Installing a Stand-Alone License. 

             Step 5     Optional: Restoring a stand-alone license. 

                        This section describes how to restore license for selected NEs. When a stand-alone license file 
                        is damaged or rolled back, you can restore the stand-alone license file. For details, see 6.9.2.8 
                       Restoring the Stand-Alone License. 

             Step 6     Optional: Adjust stand-alone license capacities. 

                       You can adjust the capacity in a stand-alone license to improve the license usage and reduce 
                       the maintenance cost of the carrier. For details, see 6.9.2.9 Adjusting the Stand-Alone 
                       License Capacity. 

             Step 7     Optional: Change the stand-alone license. 

                        If an NE ESN (Equipment Serial Number) changes or the capacity specified in a license is 
                        adjusted for the other NE, you need to change the stand-alone license. For details, see 6.9.2.10 
                        Changing a Stand-Alone License. 

             Step 8     Optional: Synchronizing stand-alone license Information.

6.9.2.3 Checking the Mapping Between Stand-Alone License and NEs 

                      This topic describes the procedure to check whether a stand-alone license is mapped properly 
                      with the NE configuration data before loading and issue the license file to the NE for 
                      installation. 

Prerequisites 

                       l    Before performing this operation, you need to synchronize NE information by following 
                            the instructions provided in 6.9.2.11 Synchronizing NE Information. 

                       l    During stand-alone license file check, the U2000 server authenticates the FTP server by 
                            default. To ensure the FTP server is authenticated and data is properly transmitted, 
                            deploy the CA certificates of the FTP server on the U2000 server before the stand-alone 
                            license file check by following the instructions provided in Importing CA Certificates. 

Context 

                      User need verify the stand-alone license with the current NE configuration, so that updated 
                      license is loaded. 

                      The function of checking a stand-alone license supports only eNodeB, DBS3900 IBS, eRelay, 
                      UGW, GGSN80, BTS3900 supporting LTE, BTS5900 supporting LTE, PICO BTS3900, 
                      MICRO BTS3900 supporting LTE and USU3900 rather than the USU3910. 

Procedure

6.9.2.4 Installing a Stand-Alone License 

                         This section describes how to load a license file for an NE present in the network. The 
                         supported functions run properly only after you install a valid license for an NE. After you 
                         successfully load a license for an NE, the license file is backed up in the U2000 server. 

Prerequisites 

                         l     The NE file Huawei technical support engineers applied for by license exists on the local 
                               host. 

                         l     Before performing this operation, you need to synchronize NE information by following 
                               the instructions provided in 6.9.2.11 Synchronizing NE Information. 

                         l     During stand-alone license file loading, the U2000 server authenticates the FTP server 
                               by default. To ensure the FTP server is authenticated and data is properly transmitted, 
                               deploy the CA certificates of the FTP server on the U2000 server before the stand-alone 
                               license file loading by following the instructions provided in Importing CA Certificates. 

Procedure 

              Step 1     Choose License > NE License Management > Stand-Alone (traditional style); alternatively, 
                         double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                         Stand-Alone (application style). 

              Step 2     In the Stand-Alone License Management navigation tree, select NE License Maintenance. 

              Step 3     Click NE License Maintenance Operation and select Load License File. 

              Step 4     In the Load License File dialog box, click                 . 

              Step 5     In the Open dialog box, select the license file based on license file loading method (single or 
                        batch).

                                    to the local computer. 

                                        NOTE 

                                         l   The active license backup file on the server is located in /opt/oss/server/var/ 
                                             standaloneNELicense/active and the inactive license backup file is located in /opt/oss/ 
                                             server/var/standaloneNELicense/inactive folders in SUSE Linux and Solaris.

                                             the loaded license file. 

                                         l   When the ESN of the device is unknown, the U2000 server does not back up the loaded 
                                             license file. 

                              b.    Repeat the previous steps to load the license file for the NE. 

6.9.2.5 Backing Up Stand-Alone Licenses 

                        This section describes how to back up selected stand-alone licenses to the U2000 server. This 
                        function helps you maintain license details for future use. 

Prerequisites 

                        l     Any Huawei technical support engineers can back up stand-alone license file. 

                        l     Before performing this operation, you need to synchronize NE license information by 
                              following the instructions provided in 6.9.2.11 Synchronizing NE Information. 

                        l     The function of backing up stand-alone licenses supports only SRAN8.1 and later. 

                        l     During stand-alone license file backup, the U2000 server authenticates the FTP server by 
                              default. To ensure the FTP server is authenticated and data is properly transmitted, 
                              deploy the CA certificates of the FTP server on the U2000 server before the stand-alone 
                              license file backup by following the instructions provided in Importing CA Certificates. 

Procedure 

              Step 1    Choose License > NE License Management > Stand-Alone (traditional style); alternatively, 
                        double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License > 
                        Stand-Alone (application style).

6.9.2.6 Obtaining a Backup Stand-Alone License File 

                       This section describes how to obtain a backup stand-alone license file from the U2000 server 
                       to your local PC. If a stand-alone license file has expired or is about to expire, you can obtain 
                       its backup file to verify the license file and upload it to the same or another NE. 

Prerequisites 

                       l    Any Huawei technical support engineers can obtain backup stand-alone license file and 
                            upload it to the same or another NE. 

                       l    You have loaded a license file by following the instructions described in 6.9.2.4 
                            Installing a Stand-Alone License or backed up an NE license file by following the

                            WinRAR 5.0 or later to open the file. The earlier versions of the software have limitations on UTF-8 
                            encoding and ZIP files containing UTF-8 characters may be corrupted when you open them using 
                            WinRAR versions earlier than 5.0. 

Procedure

6.9.2.8 Restoring the Stand-Alone License 

                         This section describes how to restore license for selected NEs. When a stand-alone license file 
                         is damaged or rolled back, you can restore the stand-alone license file. 

Prerequisites 

                         During stand-alone license file restoration, the U2000 server authenticates the FTP server by 
                         default. To ensure the FTP server is authenticated and data is properly transmitted, deploy the 
                         CA certificates of the FTP server on the U2000 server before the stand-alone license file 
                         restoration by following the instructions provided in Importing CA Certificates. 

Context 

                         License files are backed up when they are loaded for NEs. Backup license files are stored on 
                         the server. If a stand-alone license file is damaged or rolled back, you can use its backup file 
                         to restore it. 

Procedure 

              Step 1     Choose License > NE License Management > Stand-Alone (traditional style); alternatively, 
                         double-click Software Management in Application Center and choose NE License >

                              License window described under the 6.9.2.3 Checking the Mapping Between Stand-Alone License 
                              and NEs section to view the complete error information. 

6.9.2.9 Adjusting the Stand-Alone License Capacity 

                         You can adjust the capacity in a stand-alone license to improve the license usage and reduce 
                         the maintenance cost of the carrier. 

Prerequisites 

                         l     The Huawei technical support engineers provides a valid stand-alone license. 

                         l     Before performing this operation, you need to synchronize NE information by following 
                               the instructions provided in 6.9.2.11 Synchronizing NE Information. 

Context 

                         l     The U2000 supports the exchange of license capacities among different NEs. For 
                               example, a carrier has NE A and NE B. The capacities specified in the licenses of both 
                               NEs are 50. According to the service requirements, the capacity for NE B needs to 
                               increase to 80, and that for NE A needs to decrease to 20. In the precondition that the 
                               total capacity specified in the licenses of the carrier is unchanged, you can add the 
                               redundant capacity in the license of NE A to the license of NE B by using the stand- 
                               alone license capacity exchange function.

                                                     The following parameters can prevent users from forcibly loading license files 
                                                     by mistakes, which affect services: 

                                                      l   Major error: indicates an error having minor impact on services. If you are 
                                                          sure that the error only has minor impact on services, you can forcibly load 
                                                         the license file. Otherwise, you are advised to load the license file after 
                                                          eliminating the error. For example, if a resource item in a license expires but 
                                                          is within a grace period, a major error occurs when the license file is being 
                                                          loaded. 

                                                      l   Major error (risk involved): indicates an error having major impact on 
                                                          services. You are advised to load the license file after eliminating the error. 
                                                          For example, if the value of a resource item in a new license is less than the 
                                                         value configured on the NE, a major error (risk involved) occurs when the 
                                                         new license is being loaded.

            7 Network Optimization Data Collection 

About This Chapter 

                     You can collect the data required for network planning and optimization through the U2000. 
                     The neighboring cell optimization data, uplink frequency data, and MR data collected through 
                     the U2000 are stored in a specified directory on the U2000 server. Network log data is stored 
                     in the corresponding directory on a specified third-party server. The four types of data are 
                     used by network engineers to plan and optimize networks through the Nastar. 

                     7.1 Neighboring Cell Optimization Data Collection 
                     This section describes how to collect neighboring cell optimization data. By collecting 
                     neighboring cell optimization data, the U2000 provides data for the Nastar during the analysis 
                     of neighboring cells. After a data collection task for neighboring cell optimization is created 
                     on the U2000, you need to manually subscribe to the performance counters related to 
                     neighboring cell optimization. The U2000 delivers MML commands to a base station, 
                     informing it to send system messages to all UEs within the cells. Based on the system 
                     messages, UEs perform neighboring cell measurements and report the results to the U2000. 
                     The neighboring cell optimization data refers to the performance data and configuration data 
                     of cells. It shows the configurations of neighboring cells. 

                     7.2 Uplink ARFCN Data Collection 
                     This section describes the uplink ARFCN data collection function provided by the U2000. 
                     The collected data is used by the Nastar during the analysis of the uplink interference. The 
                     ARFCN data is the measurement result of the uplink level. It reflects the received signal 
                     strength of a cell frequency. The data can help network engineers choose appropriate 
                     frequencies. 

                     7.3 Network Log Data Collection 
                     Network log data consists of CHR data, neighboring cell logs, and interference logs. The 
                     CHR data records abnormal events and the related information, such as continuous delay and 
                     speech quality. The CHR data can be used for evaluating the performance of terminals, 
                     evaluating service quality, analyzing subscriber behavior, isolating and locating problems, 
                     handling user complaints, evaluating networks, and making operation decisions. Neighboring 
                     cell logs record the parameters related to terminal switch events, and the logs can be used to 
                     analyze whether neighboring cells are configured properly. Interference logs are used to 
                     analyze base station frequency interference. The U2000 collects network log data and 
                     provides the Nastar with the data. The data serves as the reference for network planning and 
                     optimization personnel to analyze network performance.

                    The U2000 provides the cell RF data collection function. The collected data is used as input 
                    for network planning and optimization tools. 

                    7.5 FFT Data Collection 
                    The U2000 provides the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) data collection function. Before 
                    collecting the FFT data, you must create an RF data collection task and export the required 
                    configuration file using a network planning and optimization tool.

                                       of Step. For example, if the parameter is set to 2, and three frequencies of 59 and 60, and 61 
                                       are selected, these three frequencies are divided into two groups of (59,60) and (61). 

                                   –   The value of Duration must meet the following requirement: Duration >= (Period x 15) x 
                                       ([Selected Frequencies/Step + 1]) + 15, where the value for Selected Frequencies/Step is 
                                       rounded down. For example, [10/3] = 3 and [11/3] = 3.

7.3.2 Manually Synchronizing Network Log Data 

                     During network log data collection, some data may be missing due to problems such as 
                     communication interruption. Within 4 hours since the data is missing, the U2000 
                     automatically synchronizes the missing data. If the data has been missing for more than 4 
                     hours, you need to manually synchronize the missing data. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    A third-party FTP server for storing network log data is configured. For details about 
                          how to configure a third-party server, see Setting a Third-Party FTP Server.

About This Chapter 

                     To re-parent NodeBs, the RNC sends a command about deleting NodeBs and then a command 
                     about creating NodeBs to the U2000. Upon receiving the command of NodeB deletion, the 
                    U2000 closes the connection with the physical NodeBs rather than directly deleting the 
                    NodeBs. In this way, you can determine the binding relation between the NodeBs before and 
                     after the re-parenting, thus avoiding the loss of alarm and performance data. 

                     8.1 Moving a NodeB in the Same RNC 
                     This section describes how to move a NodeB in the same RNC. The binding relationship can 
                    be automatically identified or manually specified. 

                     8.2 Moving a NodeB to Another RNC 
                     This section describes how to manually specify the binding relationship between the NodeBs 
                    before and after reparenting so that the NodeB can be moved to another RNC.

                      Figure 8-1 Process of moving a NodeB in the same RNC 

                        

                      The process of moving a NodeB to another RNC shown in Figure 8-1 is as follows: 

                       1.   The RNC sends a command about deleting the NodeB to the U2000.

                       3.   After the NodeB is reparented, the RNC sends a command about creating a NodeB to the 
                            U2000. 

                       4.   The U2000 searches for the NE with the same NodeBID. 

                            If an NE with the same NodeBID is found, you can infer that the created NodeB is the 
                            re-parented one. Then the system updates the information about the existing NodeB with 
                            the created NodeB. If no such a NodeB is found, the U2000 automatically searches for 
                            NodeBs and creates a new NodeB (hereinafter referred to as A'). Then you can specify 
                            the binding relation through the NodeB re-parenting tool. At the same time, the system 
                            deletes A'. 

                       5.   After the re-parenting, the state of A changes to connected.

                       l    After being bound, the NodeB turns blue in color and the node name is added binded. 

                       l    A binding record is added to the result table. You can select one or more binding records 
                            and click Remove Bind(s) to remove the binding relation. 

                       l    You can repeat Step 3 to specify multiple binding relations for bulk re-parenting. 

             Step 4    Click Confirm Move. 
                       The system automatically updates the information about A with the information about A', 
                       including NodeID and the relation with the RNC, and then deletes A'. After that, A is 
                       automatically connected to the system. 

                          NOTE 

                            A' is the logical representation of A. The IP address, belonged RNC, and sometimes the configuration 
                            information of A' are changed after the re-parenting. You need to synchronize the information about A 
                            with the information about A'. Then after the synchronization, the system deletes the logical NE A'.

Prerequisites 

                       l     You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                       l     You have the right to operate the related NEs. 

Context 

                       Figure 8-2 shows the process of moving a NodeB to another RNC.

                       The process of moving a NodeB to another RNC shown in Figure 8-2 is as follows: 

                       1.    The RNC sends a command about deleting the NodeB to the U2000. 

                       2.    The U2000 closes the connection with the NodeB (hereinafter referred to as A). 

                       3.    After the NodeB is reparented, the RNC to which the NodeB is moved sends a command 
                             about creating a NodeB to the U2000. 

                       4.    The U2000 automatically searches for the NodeB and then creates a new NodeB 
                             (hereinafter referred to as A'). 

                             After A is re-parented, it is displayed as A' and its state changes to disconnected. A' is 
                             automatically found by the U2000 and regarded as a new NE.

                             The IP addresses of NEs of the same type must be unique on the U2000. Therefore, the 
                             IP address of a NodeB must be changed after it is moved to another RNC. The conflict 
                             caused by identical IP addresses may result in the failure to create a new NodeB, and the 
                             System Output Window may display error. In this case, you need to manually change 
                             the IP address of the NodeB and then enable the U2000 to automatically search for the 
                             NodeB. 

                       5.    The user specifies the binding relation between A and A' by using the NodeB re- 
                             parenting tool. 

                             The system automatically updates the information about A, that is, NodeBID and the 
                             relation with the RNC, with the information about A', and then deletes A'.

About This Chapter 

                    This section describes how to maintain RNC pools on the U2000 client. The RNC pool is a 
                    disaster-proof solution in which NodeBs are connected to two RNCs. When the RNC 
                    currently managing NodeBs is faulty, the NodeBs are automatically switched over to the other 
                    RNC in the pool to avoid network failure and ensure service provision. 

                    9.1 RNC Pool Overview 
                    This section provides an overview of the RNC Pool feature. On a WCDMA network, an RNC 
                    is essential to the radio network subsystem (RNS) because it controls the radio access services 
                    of all UEs served by the RNS. If the RNC is faulty, the entire radio access network (RAN) 
                    breaks down. To address this problem, the U2000 introduces the RNC Pool feature, in which 
                    NodeBs are connected to two RNCs. When the RNC currently managing NodeBs is faulty, 
                    the NodeBs are automatically switched over to a secondary RNC in the pool to ensure 
                    continuous NodeB management and service handling. 

                    9.2 Maintaining RNC Pools 
                    This section describes how to maintain RNC pools on the U2000. The supported operations 
                    include viewing RNC pools in the topology view, monitoring the status of RNC pools, and 
                    checking information about NodeB homing switchovers.

9.1 RNC Pool Overview 

                    This section provides an overview of the RNC Pool feature. On a WCDMA network, an RNC 
                    is essential to the radio network subsystem (RNS) because it controls the radio access services 
                    of all UEs served by the RNS. If the RNC is faulty, the entire radio access network (RAN) 
                    breaks down. To address this problem, the U2000 introduces the RNC Pool feature, in which 
                    NodeBs are connected to two RNCs. When the RNC currently managing NodeBs is faulty, 
                    the NodeBs are automatically switched over to a secondary RNC in the pool to ensure 
                    continuous NodeB management and service handling. 

Function Background 

                    The responsibilities for managing NodeBs and handling services are quickly switched over 
                    from the primary RNC to the secondary RNC in the following situations: 

                    l    The primary RNC is damaged due to urgency such as fire and water immersion. 

                    l    The primary RNC is restarted or some of its service boards are restarted because of a 
                         software upgrade. 

                    l    The Iu interface between the primary RNC and the core network (CN) is faulty. 

                    l    The board of the primary RNC experiences hardware faults. 

                    l    The Iub transmission link between NodeBs and the active RNC is faulty. 

                    l    Flow control occurs because the service process unit (SPU) load of the active RNC 
                         exceeds the maximum limit. 

                    Figure 9-1 shows the architecture of a WCDMA network that adopts the RNC Pool feature.

                        In Figure 9-1: 

                        l    Each NodeB on the network is connected to two RNCs through two Iub interfaces, as the 
                                  and the         shown in Figure 9-1. Using these interfaces, the NCP, CCP, OM 
                             channel, and transmission link on the user plane are established between the NodeB and 
                             each RNC. 

                        l    The logical links of the Iub interfaces can be deployed on only one physical link or on 
                             two independent physical links. The NodeBs can be deployed on two different SPUs of 
                             the RNCs because the RNCs do not require same hardware configuration. 

                       When creating or reconfiguring an RNC pool, note that: 

                        l    The U2000 is configured as the relay server for NodeBs. This ensures that file transfer 
                             and distribution are not affected after the NodeBs are switched over from one RNC to 
                             the other RNC in the pool. 

                        l    A backup license is required for the primary and secondary RNCs in the pool. This 
                             ensures that all NodeBs can obtain some resources after they are switched over from one 
                             RNC to the other. 

                        l    The creation or reconfiguration affects northbound data in the following aspects: 

                              –    Northbound NodeB data such as alarm, performance, and configuration data is 
                                   reported to the U2000 by NodeB. The name of each file exported from the file 
                                   interface contains information about the RNC that NodeBs are concurrently

                               same. 

                          –    When NodeBs are switch over from one RNC to the other RNC in the pool, logical 
                               NodeB data changes. Then the RNC that the NodeBs are currently homing reports 
                               the northbound data to the U2000. 

Function Description 

                     The RNC Pool feature is implemented at the NM layer by U2000 and CME. 

                     The U2000 provides the following functions, allowing you to centrally maintain RNC pools: 

                     l    Displaying RNC pools in the topology view: The U2000 supports the display of RNC 
                          pools on the entire network, with the navigation tree on the left and the topology view on 
                          the right. By viewing the topology view, you can query the primary and secondary RNCs 
                          in each pool. 

                     l    Monitoring the homing of NodeBs in RNC pools: The U2000 displays RNCs and 
                          NodeBs according to the homing of NodeBs in real time. 

                     l    Switching over NodeBs between the primary and secondary RNCs in a pool, without 
                          data loss: If a NodeB has been switched over from the primary RNC to the secondary 
                          RNC, the U2000 reparents all OM data like alarms, performance data, inventory data, 
                          and logs of the NodeB to the secondary RNC accordingly. 

                     l    Managing NodeB licenses according to the RNC pool: The U2000 manages NodeB 
                          licenses based on the RNCs controlling the NodeBs. A telecom operator needs to apply 
                          for a certain number of resources in total based on the networking of the RNC pool. This 
                          ensures that all NodeBs can obtain some resources after they are switched over from one 
                          RNC to the other RNC in the pool. 

                     The CME provides configuration, reconfiguration, and data consistency check for the RNC 
                    Pool feature. 

9.2 Maintaining RNC Pools 

                     This section describes how to maintain RNC pools on the U2000. The supported operations 
                     include viewing RNC pools in the topology view, monitoring the status of RNC pools, and 
                     checking information about NodeB homing switchovers. 

Prerequisites 

                     l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                     l    RNCs and the U2000 server are connected properly. 

Procedure 

            Step 1   Choose Topology > Main Topology (traditional style); alternatively, double-click Topo View 
                     in Application Center and choose Topology > Main Topology (application style) . The 
                    Main Topology window is displayed. 

            Step 2   Select RNC Pool View from the Current View drop-down list. 

                     The topology view displays all RNC pools and all RNCs in the RNC pools.

About This Chapter 

                    The BSC Pool is a disaster tolerance mechanism that is implemented by configuring two 
                    BSCs for one BTS to prevent system breakdown caused by BSC faults. This section describes 
                    the methods of managing the BSC Pool on the U2000 client. 

                    10.1 Maintaining the BSC Pool 
                    The BSC Pool is a disaster tolerance mechanism that is implemented by configuring two 
                    BSCs for one BTS to prevent system breakdown caused by BSC faults. By viewing the BSC 
                    Pool topology, you can learn about the BSC Pool information such as the BSCs and BTSs in a 
                    BSC Pool and the homing status of a BTS (for example, the primary BSC and the current 
                    BSC of the BTS). 

                    10.2 GUIs for the BSC Pool View 
                    This section describes the BSC Pool View window and provides information about each 
                    element in the window. 

                    10.3 Parameters for Monitoring the BSC Pool 
                    This section describes the parameters for monitoring the BSC pool in the BSC Pool Monitor

10.1 Maintaining the BSC Pool 

                    The BSC Pool is a disaster tolerance mechanism that is implemented by configuring two 
                    BSCs for one BTS to prevent system breakdown caused by BSC faults. By viewing the BSC 
                    Pool topology, you can learn about the BSC Pool information such as the BSCs and BTSs in a 
                    BSC Pool and the homing status of a BTS (for example, the primary BSC and the current 
                    BSC of the BTS). 

Prerequisites 

                    l    You have logged in to the U2000 client. 

                    l    BSCs are properly connected to the U2000 server. 

Procedure 

           Step 1   Choose Topology > Main Topology (traditional style); alternatively, double-click Topo View 
                    in Application Center and choose Topology > Main Topology (application style) . The 
                    Main Topology window is displayed. 

           Step 2   Select BSC Pool View from the Current View drop-down list box. 
                    The topology view displays all BSC Pools, as well as BSCs and BTSs in each BSC Pool. 

           Step 3   Perform the following operations as required. 

                     If you need to...                Then... 

                     Switch between the primary-      If a BTS is configured with the primary- and secondary- 
                     and secondary-homed BSCs         homed BSCs, perform the following steps to switch 
                                                      between the BSCs: 

                                                      Right-click the BTS and choose Go To Relating BTS 
                                                      from the shortcut menu. The U2000 automatically 
                                                      switches the BTS from the current BSC to the peer BSC. 

                     Query BTS alarms                 If a BTS is configured with the primary- and secondary- 
                                                      homed BSCs, perform the following steps to query the 
                                                      BTS alarms under the primary-homed BSC: 

                                                      Right-click the BTS and choose Query Alarm/Event 
                                                      from the shortcut menu.

About This Chapter 

                    RNC in Pool is a mechanism for load sharing and node redundancy between RNCs. In the 
                    RNC in Pool view, you can learn the mapping between logical RNCs and physical RNCs 
                    (master RNCs and backup/overflow RNCs) in a pool, and the enabling status of load sharing 
                    and node redundancy functions. 

                    For details about RNC in Pool, see RNC in Pool Feature Parameter Description in RAN 
                    feature documentation.

                        Parameter         Description 

                        Logical           A logical RNC is a logical node that controls radio resource usage in the 
                        RNC ID            radio network subsystem (RNS). As indicated in 3GPP specifications, a 
                                          logical RNC is specified by RNC ID. 

                                          A logical RNC is specified by the RNC ID parameter. 

                        Master            The NodeBs and external standard interfaces of a logical RNC belong to a 
                        RNC               physical RNC. This physical RNC is the master RNC of the logical RNC. 
                                          The physical RNC, if not faulty, is the OM entity of the logical RNC. The 
                                          RNC OM mechanism is unchanged after RNC in Pool is introduced. 

                        Overflow          An overflow RNC of a logical RNC takes over services from the master 
                        RNC               RNC of the logical RNC when certain conditions are met. Overflow RNCs 
                                          are used for load sharing. 

                        Load              Load sharing policies are classified into the following types. 
                        Sharing           l   CP_SHARE: indicates that load sharing is conducted only on the 
                        Policy                control plane. 

                                          l   NO_SHARE: indicates that load sharing is not used. 

                                          l   UP_SHARE: indicates user-plane load sharing policy. 

                        Backup            A backup RNC of a logical RNC is a non-master physical RNC connected 
                        RNC               to dual-homed NodeBs under the logical RNC. Backup RNCs are used for 
                                          node redundancy. 

                        Redundancy        Node redundancy is classified into Manual and No Redundancy. 
                        Mode 
                                          l   Manual: indicates that you must manually switch over the NodeB 
                                              control between the master and backup RNCs for node redundancy. 

                                          l   No Redundancy: indicates that node redundancy is not used.

12.1 Overview of the Cloud BB View 

                     The Cloud BB includes a cluster of base stations associated by the switch. The Cloud BB 
                     view on the U2000 allows users to view and maintain NEs in the Cloud BB. 

Background 

                     The Cloud BB includes a cluster of base stations associated by the switch. The Cloud BB 
                     allows inter-base station service collaboration. 

                     Purposes and scenarios of the inter-base station service collaboration are as follows: 

                     l    Improving single-user experience 

                          Generally, a mobile terminal is associated with only one cell at certain time. With inter- 
                          cell service collaboration, one mobile terminal can use resources of multiple cells. This 
                          increases the single-user peak rate and improves cell edge coverage. 

                     l    Reducing inter-cell interferences 

                          Inter-cell service collaboration and scheduling decreases the RB co-channel interference 
                          (CCI) rate of cell edges. 

Function Description 

                     The Cloud BB view on the U2000 allows users to view and maintain USU3910, BTS3900 
                     LTE, BTS3900, BTS5900 LTE, and BTS5900 devices in the Cloud BB solution. The U2000 
                     automatically synchronizes NEs in the Cloud BB view. 

                     The Cloud BB view applies to the following devices: USU3910, BTS3900 LTE, BTS3900, 
                     BTS5900 LTE, and BTS5900 devices. 

                     In the Cloud BB view, the interconnections between the USUs and the base stations are as

             14 DHCP Configuration Management 

About This Chapter 

                    To help NEs automatically obtain IP addresses by using the DHCP service, the U2000 
                    provides the DHCP configuration management function. This function helps users query and 
                    maintain the DHCP information about each NE and view the DHCP process of each NE 
                    through the graphical user interface (GUI). 

                     14.1 Overview of the DHCP 
                    This section describes the basic concepts related to DHCP functions. 

                     14.2 Managing DHCP Information About Base Stations 
                    The U2000 provides the GUI for the DHCP server to implement DHCP services and manage 
                    the DHCP information about base stations. You can query the DHCP information about a base 
                    station through the U2000 and view the DHCP process logs of the base station and the DHCP 
                    server information. You can manually add, modify, or delete the DHCP information about a 
                    base station during network adjustment or the connection/reparenting of a small number of 
                    base stations. You can create or modify the DHCP information about base stations in batches 
                    through file export and import during batch site deployment or base station reparenting.

                    This section describes how to start or stop the VLAN detection. The entire network is divided 
                    into several VLANs to fulfill the security and management requirements. After an NE is 
                    initially configured, the VLAN detection is required to obtain the VLAN ID of the VLAN on 
                    which the DHCP server is located. The NE sends DHCP requests to the DHCP server 
                    according to the obtained VLAN ID.

14.1 Overview of the DHCP 

                     This section describes the basic concepts related to DHCP functions. 

Introduction to the DHCP 

                     The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is developed on the basis of the Bootstrap 
                     Protocol (BOOTP). The DHCP provides information such as IP addresses to Internet hosts on 
                     the TCP/IP network. In the radio communication system, the DHCP is used to automatically 
                     search for NEs when the NEs are powered on and to assign initial configuration data for NEs, 
                     such as IP addresses. The application scenarios of the DHCP are as follows: 

                     l    Initial site deployment: 

                          The information such as the IP address is configured (synchronized) on the U2000. After 
                          an NE is powered on, the IP address request process is triggered. 

                     l    NE reparenting 

                          The information such as the IP address is reconfigured (resynchronized) on the U2000. 
                          After the NE is reparented and reset, the IP address request process is triggered. 

                     The DHCP adopts the C/S structure. Components of the DHCP are described as follows: 

                     l    DHCP server: Functioning as the DHCP server, the U2000 can manage IP addresses and 
                          other parameters, and process DHCP requests of NEs. You can allocate DHCP 
                          information for multiple types of NEs by using the DHCP configuration management 
                          function of the U2000. 

                                    NOTICE 

                          The DHCP server only listens to requests from the southbound IP address of the master 
                          server or board on the U2000. You can only set the DHCP relay IP address for base 
                          stations to the southbound IP address of the master server or board on the U2000 to 
                          avoid incorrect packet forwarding. For example, IP addresses of the slave servers or 
                          database boards are not allowed. If the NAT server is configured for theU2000, set the 
                          DHCP relay IP address to the southbound IP address (after NAT conversion) of the 
                          master server or board. 

                     l    DHCP client: Functioning as DHCP clients, NEs request the DHCP server to allocate 
                          information such as IP addresses to them. 

                     l    DHCP relay: The DHCP relay provides transparent transmission function for DHCP 
                          messages. The DHCP relay enables the DHCP client to communicate with the DHCP 
                          server that is on the network segment different from the DHCP client. If the DHCP 
                          server and client are on different network segments, the router on the network needs to 
                          serve as the DHCP relay. 

                     l    U2000 DHCP configuration management: The DHCP configuration management 
                          function provides the GUI for you to query and maintain DHCP information about NEs. 

Configuration Management Function of the DHCP 

                     The U2000 provides the GUI for you to query DHCP information and DHCP process logs of 
                     NEs in real time. You can also perform various operations such as importing and exporting

14.2 Managing DHCP Information About Base Stations 

                      The U2000 provides the GUI for the DHCP server to implement DHCP services and manage 
                     the DHCP information about base stations. You can query the DHCP information about a base 
                      station through the U2000 and view the DHCP process logs of the base station and the DHCP 
                      server information. You can manually add, modify, or delete the DHCP information about a 
                     base station during network adjustment or the connection/reparenting of a small number of 
                     base stations. You can create or modify the DHCP information about base stations in batches 
                     through file export and import during batch site deployment or base station reparenting.

14.3 Starting/Stopping VLAN Detecting 

                       This section describes how to start or stop the VLAN detection. The entire network is divided 
                       into several VLANs to fulfill the security and management requirements. After an NE is 
                       initially configured, the VLAN detection is required to obtain the VLAN ID of the VLAN on 
                       which the DHCP server is located. The NE sends DHCP requests to the DHCP server 
                       according to the obtained VLAN ID. 

Prerequisites 

                       The communication network adopts the VLAN networking mode.

Context 

                    After receiving the DHCP detection request, the layer 2 network devices add the VLAN ID to 
                    the UDP detection message and forward the detection message to the VLANs that are 
                    managed by the layer 2 network. The NEs in the VLAN obtain VLAN IDs according to the 
                    detection message. When initiating a DHCP request, the NE advertises the DHCP request to 
                    specific VLANs according to the obtained VLAN IDs. 

Procedure 

           Step 1   Choose Configuration > DHCP Configuration Management (traditional style); 
                    alternatively, double-click Configuration in Application Center and choose Settings > 
                    DHCP Configuration Management (application style). The DHCP Configuration 
                    Management window is displayed. 

           Step 2   Click the tab of the NE that you want to detect. 

           Step 3   Select the NEs to be detected. You can select an NE by using multiple methods in different 
                    scenarios. 

                     Scenario                                   Method 

                     Detecting the VLAN over all the NEs         l  Click      on the toolbar. 

                                                                 l  In the NE list area, press Ctrl+A. 

                     Detecting the VLAN over a specified        Press and hold Ctrl or Shift to select the NEs to 
                     NE                                         be detected. 

                     Detecting the VLAN over the NEs             l  Click      on the toolbar. 
                     whose IP addresses are not assigned 

           Step 4   Start or stop VLAN detection. For the NEs that are detecting the VLAN, it is impossible to 
                    restart the VLAN detection. 

                    l    Click      to start VLAN detection. 

                    l    Click      to stop VLAN detection. 

                    ----End 

Follow-up Procedure 

                    After the VLAN detection, the NE obtains the VLAN ID of the network where the U2000 is 
                    located. Then, the NE sends a DHCP request to a specific VLAN. After receiving the DHCP 
                    request, the DHCP server queries the DHCP configuration information according to the 
                    electronic serial number of the NE and sends the information to the NE through UDP 
                    messages.

                      This section describes the basic knowledge that you need to know when reparent CBTSs, 
                      which involves the introduction to reparenting scenarios and usage of the data planning table 
                      for CBTS reparenting. 

15.1.1 Overview of CBTS Reparenting 

                      This section describes CBTS reparenting scenarios. During actual network operation, you 
                      need to reparent CBTSs owing to various reasons such as network planning, load balancing, 
                      and capacity expansion. 

Intra-CBSC CBTS Reparenting 

                      Intra-CBSC CBTS reparenting refers to reparenting a CBTS from one SPU subsystem to 
                      another inside the CBSC, as shown in Figure 15-1. 

                      Figure 15-1 Intra-CBSC CBTS reparenting 

                        

                      As shown in Figure 15-1, intra-CBSC CBTS reparenting involves the following scenarios: 

                       l    Scenario 1: The subrack and physical port that carry the CBTS are not changed, and the 
                            CBTS is reparented only from one SPU subsystem to another. 

                       l    Scenario 2: The subrack that carries the CBTS is not changed, the physical port that 
                            carries the CBTS is changed, and the CBTS is reparented from one SPU subsystem to 
                            another. 

                       l    Scenario 3: The subrack and physical port that carry the CBTS are changed, and the 
                            CBTS is reparented from one SPU subsystem to another.

Inter-CBSC CBTS Reparenting 

                     Inter-CBSC CBTS reparenting refers to reparenting a CBTS from one CBSC to another, as 
                     shown in Figure 15-2.

15.2.5 Description of Constraints 

                     This section describes the constraints to be followed when you use the CBTS reparenting 
                     function. 

                     The constraints are as follows: 

                     1.    Only the CBTSs managed by the same U2000 can be reparented. 

                     2.   The CBTSs can be reparented between the CBSCs of the same version. 

                     3.    Only the CBTSs of the 3900 series can be reparented. 

                     4.   The reparenting of a cascaded CBTS can be performed from the root node rather than a 
                          leaf node. 

                     5.    The version of a CBTS remains unchanged when it is reparented. 

                     6.    The type of a CBSC interface board may be changed but the interface board must 
                           support the connection to a CBTS after the CBTS is reparented. 

                     7.   The hardware configuration of a CBTS remains unchanged after it is reparented, that is, 
                          the number of interface boards of the CBTS remains unchanged. 

                     8.    The cascaded relation of a CBTS remains unchanged after it is reparented. That is, after 
                          being reparented to the peer CBSC, the CBTS can only be directly connected to the 
                          CBSC. 

                     9.    In Fractional IMA or Fractional ATM transport mode, the E1/T1 timeslot assignment 
                          remains unchanged of a CBTS remains unchanged after it is reparented. 

                     10.   In a project, the CBTS connected to multiple CBSCs cannot be reparented to the same 
                          destination CBSC at the same time.

                    11.  In a project, the CBTSs connected to one CBSC cannot be reparented to multiple 
                         destination CBSCs at the same time. 

                    12.  In a project, either intra-CBSC or inter-CBSC CBTS reparenting is supported. 

                    13.  The resource conflict check is not supported between multiple projects. 

                    14.  The reparenting of a hub CBTS is not supported. 

                    15.  The MGW and MSCe data cannot be modified. 

                    16.  Only the data of the source and destination CBSCs can be modified. The data of 
                         neighboring CBSCs cannot be modified. 

15.2.6 Synchronizing NE Data 

                    This section describes how to synchronize the data of the source CBSC, destination CBSC, 
                    neighboring CBSC, and to-be-reparented CBTS before configuring the reparenting data. 

Prerequisites 

                    You have opened the main window of CBTS reparenting. 

Context 

                    l    NE data synchronization can be performed in the case of manual synchronization or a 
                         new project. 

                    l    Reparenting data check can be performed only after the data of the source CBSC, 
                         destination CBSC, and to-be-reparented CBTS is synchronized. 

Procedure 

           Step 1   Select the operation that triggers NE data synchronization. 

                     Option              Description 

                     Creating a          For the detailed operations, see Creating a Project. 
                     project 

                     Manual              Right-click the NE in the navigation tree, and then choose Synchronize 
                     synchronization     from the shortcut menu. 

           Step 2   Wait until the system completes NE data synchronization. 

                    When the progress is 100% on the status bar, you can infer that the NE data is synchronized. 

           Step 3   (Optional) Double-click the task for synchronizing NE data. The Synchronize Detailed 
                    Result Information dialog box containing the synchronization result is displayed.

15.2.9 Activating the Reparenting Data 

                       This section describes how to activate the reparenting data in a project and query the 
                       activation result after modifying and checking the data. 

Prerequisites 

                       l     You have opened the main window of CBTS reparenting. 

                       l     The reparenting data has passed the check. 

Context 

                       You can activate only one project at a time and you are not allowed to pause or stop the 
                       activation when it is started. 

Procedure 

             Step 1    Clear the Flash data on the source CBSC. 

                           NOTE 

                             l  The source CBSC acts as an agent for clearing the Flash data of the to-be-reparented CBTS. If the 
                                data clearance is not performed, the CBTS may be started according to the old configuration script 
                                on the source CBSC after it is reparented. This leads to a configuration error. 

                             l  You can perform the data clearance on the U2000 or use ssh to connect the CBTS and then run the 
                                MML command ERS CBTSFILE to clear the Flash data on the CBTS. 

                             l  The Clean Flash Configuration of BTS menu is available only after the reparenting data has 
                                passed the check. It becomes unavailable when the reparenting data is activated. 

                             l  Flash data clearance needs to be performed on all the to-be-reparented CBTSs before the reparenting 
                                data is activated. Otherwise, you can only manually clear the Flash data in the future. 

                        1.   (Optional) Open a project. 

                             For the detailed operations, see Opening a Project. The reparenting data must be saved 
                             in this project. 

                       2.    On the shortcut toolbar of the CBSS BTS Reparenting Management window, choose 
                             Clean Flash Configuration of BTS from the Active drop-down list box. The Clean 
                             Flash Configuration of BTS dialog box is displayed. 

                       3.    Select the check box in Need Clear to specify the CBTS whose Flash data needs to be 
                             cleared, click Clean. The Confirm dialog box is displayed. 

                       4.    Click Yes. The system starts to clear the Flash data. You can view the progress in the 
                             status bar in the lower area of the window.

        21 Multioperator Network Management 

                      The RAN sharing feature enables multiple telecom operators to share radio access network 
                      (RAN) devices. The multioperator core network (MOCN) feature enables multiple telecom 
                      operators to share cells. To support the two features, the U2000 provides functions, such as 
                      multioperator parameter setting, northbound interface (NBI) management. For details about 
                      the principle for RAN sharing and the guide for data configuration, see MOCN Feature 
                      Parameter Description and RAN Sharing Feature Parameter Description released along 
                      with NE product documentation. 

Context 

                      The U2000 provides the following functions: 

                       l    NMS user management: 

                            Before using the NBI, network management system (NMS) users need to log in to the 
                            OSS self-maintenance unit (OSMU) of the U2000, add telecom operator and NMS user 
                            information using the NBI management function, and check that the added telecom 
                            operator information is the same as that configured on the RAN NE side. Related 
                            operations include setting telecom operator information, setting NMS user information, 
                            setting the period for synchronizing RAN sharing information, and setting the RAN 
                            sharing switch over the NBI. 

                                NOTE 

                                 If the U2000 is deployed using the remote high availability (HA) solution, users need to 
                                 synchronize the settings to the standby server after they set the preceding information on the active 
                                 server. 

                       l    NBI management: 

                            After information about telecom operators and NMS users are set, the NMS user of a 
                            specified telecom operator can only view or modify information, such as resource 
                            configuration, performance data, and alarm data, of the specified telecom operator. 
                            Resources of each telecom operator are managed through the telecom operator indexes, 
                            RAN sharing category codes, and resource distribution policies configured on telecom 
                            operators' NEs. 

                            The NBIs that the RAN sharing feature supports include: 

                             –    CORBA interface 

                             –    Performance file interface (NE-based) 

                             –    Performance file interface (measurement unit-based)

                           In the multioperator sharing scenario, files are transferred using XFTP (FTP is short for 
                          File Transfer Protocol). Different target FTP servers are specified for different telecom 
                           operator directories. By default, the dialog box for selecting subdirectories is not 
                           displayed, and users need to modify the configuration file in order to enable this 
                           function.

        22 Transmission Device Fault Detection 

                                           for the Small-cell Base Station 

                     This section describes how to detect transmission faults of the small-cell base station when 
                     the OM link of the small-cell base station is faulty or the cells are out of service. Users can 
                     query the information about the peer transmission device corresponding to the small-cell base 
                     station on the U2000, and detect and locate the peer transmission device faults on the U2000 
                     where the MBB backhaul management component is installed. Through checking last-mile 
                     transmission devices, users can quickly locate the faulty node, reducing the manual 
                     maintenance workload at the local end of the small-cell base station. 

Prerequisites 

                     The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) function has been enabled for the peer 
                     transmission device.

                            information engineering file of the faulty LampSite from the U2000 for analysis. At the 
                            same time, the U2000 exports the alarm information about the LampSite base station as a 
                            file to the local PC. For detailed operations, see Export a LampSite location 
                            information engineering file and alarm information. The maintenance personnel can 
                            troubleshoot the fault based on the obtained information.

                      After a pico base station is deployed, you can import a pico location information engineering 
                      file to the U2000 server to save it. If the pico base station is faulty, you can export its fault 
                      information and location information engineering file for maintenance personnel to locate the 
                      fault. 

Context 

                       l    The Pico Location Info Management menu is displayed on the client only after a pico 
                            base station mediation is installed.

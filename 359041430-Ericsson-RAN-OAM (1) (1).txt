I  am  happy   to  note   that  Consumer  Mobility  vertical  has  taken  an  initiative   to  provide  a  

comprehensive,   OEM   technology   wise,   ‘Operations   &   Maintenance   Handbook’   for   routine  

operation and maintenance. In this series, this handbook on Ericsson will be extremely beneficial  

for use by our Technicians and Engineers in 17 Circles of North and East Zones.    

  

I feel that such a Ready compilation of day to day O & M activities, being followed in the 17 circles,  

at one place will go a long way in helping our field units to learn from good practices being followed  

in other circles.   

  

I congratulate Director (CM) Shri R. K. Mittal and his team for this great initiative and efforts. I am  

looking forward for release of such O&M Handbooks for other technologies.

I  am  very  glad  to  see  that  the  Handbook  on  CMTS  Operation  and  Maintenance  for  Ericsson  

technology has been made first time in BSNL. Availability of this comprehensive Handbook with  

the  field  engineers  and  technicians  for  carrying  out  day  to  day  operation  and  maintenance  

activities is of paramount importance.    

  

I am sure that this Handbook will help and encourage operation and maintenance personals for  

constant  monitoring  and  taking  immediate  remedial  actions  through  OMC-R  &  OMC-S  for  

improving  QoS  parameters.  This  Handbook  will  help  to  solve  problems  related  to:  handover  

issues; call drop issues; SDCCH/TCH congestion; SDCCH/TCH blocking; VSWR issues; call setup  

success rate; etc.  

  

Basic  guidelines  also  on  conducting  Drive  Test,  Optimisation,  etc  has  been  provided  for  field  

personal  who  will  immediately  be  able  to  start  drive  testing  and  RF  optimisation  activities.  This  

Handbook  is  only  the  beginning  and  suggestions  for  improvement  may  be  sent  by  email  to  

srgmnwocm_co@bsnl.co.in  

  

I thank Dr Biswajit Paul SrGM/CM Orissa Circle and other officers of East Zone Circles for their  

hard work and sincere efforts to bring out this much desired Handbook. I also thank Shri Shyam  

Narain, Dr S K Samanta, Shri Kishore Bhagtani, and other officers of BSNL CO for their valuable  

contribution.

A  comprehensive  handbook  for  O&M  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  the  field  engineers  and  

technicians  is  one  of  the  most  critical  pieces  of  document  and  is  required  in  hand  for  smooth  

maintenance as well as speedy resolution of various issues. There has always been a need of one  

comprehensive book for resolving most of the day to day issues faced by network engineers and  

technicians in the field.   

  

This  handbook  is  a  result  of  an  idea  initiated  by  Shri  R  K  Mittal,  DIR  (CM)  BSNL  Board  and  

translated by teams of experienced officers of various levels both at BSNL Corporate Office and in  

the Circles. The final version is compiled by Dr S K Samanta AddlGM (NWO-CM) and Shri Kishore  

Bhagtani DGM (NWO-CM) BSNL Corporate Office under the guidance of SrGM (NWO-CM) BSNL  

CO and Dir (CM) BSNL Board.  

  

This  Handbook  will  not  only  help  the  existing  officers,  engineers  and  technicians  in  SSAs  and  

circle offices, but will be very much useful to those new personnel, who will be posted for day to  

day operation and maintenance activities for  CMTS networks of Ericsson Technologies  in the  

coming days.

﻿ 1.  Introduction  

      A mobile network consists of: a) a  access part -  Base Station Subsystem  (BSS); and b) a  

      core part - Network Subsystem (NSS). BSS Networks consists of: Base Transceiver Stations  

      (BTS)  and  Base  Station  Controller  (BSC).  NSS  Networks  consists  of:  Mobile  Switching  

      Centre  (MSC),  Home  Location  Register  (HLR),  Visitor  Location  Register  (VLR),  IN  and  

      Billing & Customer Care Systems (B&CCS).

1.1. BSS Networks  

      The  main  components  of  BSS  networks  consists  of  two  parts:  i)  Radio  -  BTS,  BTS-BSC  

      links,  BSC  and  ii)  Infra  -  Tower,  Diesel  Generator  (DG),  Air  Conditioners  (AC)  or  Free  

      Cooling  System  (FCS),  -48  Volt  Battery  and  Power  Plant.  BTS  to  BSC  links  are  either  

      provided   through   OFC   networks   (i.e.   CPE,   ADM.   MADM,   etc)   or   through   Digital  

      Microwave (i.e. Mini Link).

                                                           9  
  
﻿1.2. Base  Transceiver  Stations  (BTS):  BTS  or  access  nodes  provides  connection  to  a  user  

      through a wireless local loop, with authorisation for access and call managed by HLR, VLR,  

      IN  and  B&CCS.  The  wireless  loop  is  only  used  when  a  call  is  in  progress  and  is  shared  

      among the BTS users served in a geographical area; this typically covers a radius up to 20km  

      (if there is no obstruction e.g tall buildings). The traffic from several BTS’s is multiplexed at  

      the Base Station Controller (BSC) which relays to the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) thus  

     providing  the  connection  between  users.  A  BTS  is  designed  according  to:  minutes  of  call,  

      number of messages and amount of Data to be provided in a specific time period. Assuming a  

      BTS is designed to handle 1000 minutes of calls per hour, it could provide 200 users with 5  

      minutes or alternatively 500 users with 2 minutes of calls. It is clear there can be more users if  

      the  call  duration  is  less.  This  is  not  the  case  in  a  wire  line  network  where  a  dedicated  

      connection  from  the  access  node  is  provided  for  each  user.  This  characteristic  of  mobile  

      networks  suggests  a  different  strategy  be  folowed  in  providing  desired Quality  of  Services  

      (QoS) to Mobile users.   

       

      A successful call/connection uses two links for transport of information: 1) originating links:  

      and 2) terminating links. When both the links of a call are provided by the same BTS it is  

      defined as intra BTS call otherwise it is called inter BTS call. Both the intra BTS and inter  

      BTS call passes through BSC and is switched at MSC. When a call is terminated in a network  

      managed by a different operator it is routed via a Gateway MSC (GMSC).   

       

      Authorisation for access to the mobile network to a user is done by allocating a unique mobile  

      number against the subscribers’ Service Identity Module (SIM) and creating a matching data  

     base in the HLR. The Mobile Equipment (ME) with the SIM inserted in it is generally called  

      the  Mobile  Station  (MS)  and  communicates  to  HLR  through  BTS,  BSC  and  MSC  to  get  

      access to the network.   

      Components such as the BTS, BSC and their interconnections are used for the transport of all  

      services, whereas components like MSC and links between BSC-MSC and MSC-GMSC are  

      only  used  for  voice  and  low  speed  Data  such  as  the  Short  Message  Service  (SMS).  For  

      message services like SMS and Multimedia Message Services (MMS) additional nodes such  

      as Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) and Multimedia Message Service Centre (MMSC)  

      are used to store and forward the message.  

                                                        10  
  
﻿Traffic  such  as  a  voice  call  is  carried  through  a  Traffic  Channel  (TCH)  which  transports  

information usually measured in kbps (kilo bits per second). For a  full rate voice call each  

TCH carries 12.2 kbps whereas the Data rate per TCH can be up to 59.2 kbps depending on  

the  modulation  scheme  and  technology  e.g.  GPRS  or  EDGE.  A  BTS  configured  with  4  

carriers  per  sector  i.e.  total  96  channels  is  generally  connected  to  a  BSC  with  a  2  Mbps  

(Millions of bits per second) link i.e. 1E1. This 2Mbps is not sufficient for high Data usage  

customers in urban areas and therefore 2 nos of 2Mbps links i.e. 2E1 per BTS to BSC is

Smart  Phone  users  heavily  uses  Data  services  such  as  e-mail,  browsing,  download  and  

audio/video  streaming  and  these  services  do  not  use  elements  such  as  the  MSC  and  BSC- 

MSC links. Technologies such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates  

for GSM Evolution (EDGE), third Generation (3G) and forth Generation (4G) are generally  

employed  for  these  Data  services.  It  uses  Packet  Handling  Nodes  (PHN)  such  as  Packet  

Controller  Units  (PCU),  Serving  GPRS  Support  Nodes  (SGSN),  Gateway  GPRS  Support  

Nodes   (GGSN)   and   Routers   in   place   of   MSCs.   The   resources   of   BTS,   BSC   and  

interconnected links are used to update the location by each active mobile set even in the idle  

state. The volume of such traffic is small but adequate no of communication channels need to  

be defined.   

  

The authorisation to access a mobile network is controlled by elements such as the HLR, the  

Authentication   Centre   (AuC),   the   Equipment   Identity   Register   (EIR),   the   VLR   and  

IN/B&CCS. HLR, AuC and EIR is normally configured in the same hardware and in general  

there  are two systems (1 + 1) for each geographical area ( circle ) for redundancy purposes.  

An HLR can provide access to the tune of 10.0 million subscribers and can be connected to  

more than one MSC. Each MSC is paired with a VLR which temporarily stores the data for  

the  customers  who  visits  the  area  under  the  radio  coverage  of  the  BTSs  connected  to  the  

MSC.

     DISTRIBUTION SWITCH UNIT (DXU)  

     The Distribution Switch Unit (DXU) is the RBS central control unit. There is one DXU per  
     RBS.  It  provides  a  system  interface  by  cross  connecting  2Mbit/s  transport  network  and  
     individual time slots to their associated transceivers.  
       
     TRANSCEIVER UNIT (TRU)  
     It is a transmitter/receiver and signal processing unit which broadcasts and receives the radio  
     frequency signals that are passed to and from the mobile station. Each TRU handles 8 airtime  
     slots (i.e. TCH).  
       
     COMBINING AND DISTRIBUTION UNIT (CDU)  
     A combiner is a device, at the base station, that allows connection of several transmitters to  
     one antenna. It allows each transmitter’s RF energy out to the antenna, while blocking the RF  
     energy  from  the  other  transmitters  utilizing  the  same  antenna.  There  are  two  types  of  
     combiners:  
   Hybrid  
   Filter

      Understanding the Channel window  
      When you open a channel normally two windows are shown, the upper window is the Output  
      window, and the lower one is the Input Window. You can toggle between windows by using  
      Alt+F5.  
        
      Ericsson Commands  
        
 1>  Logging into BSC with new channel: Whenever you open the  channel that you have just  
      created, will ask for User ID and Password.  
        
           Login :<UID>                          Password:<PW>  
             

      After that you are connected to the OSS.

﻿3.2   IMPROVEMENT OF 2G DATA SERVICES  

       Performance of 2G DATA are to be monitored and to be analyzed on regular basis.   

       Important 2G DATA Reports and parameters----  

   1.   Busy Hour/ Whole Day Traffic( Both Uplink and Downlink)  
  2.   Average/ Peak Throughput  
   3.   Packet Channel Allocation Attempts and Failure  
  4.   GSL Device Utilization ( PCU- RPP Card Utilization)   
   5.   RPP Card Load   
   6.   Gb Utilization (Gb interface over Frame Relay)   
   7.   No. of Channel GPRS/ EDGE dedicated and dynamic---OMC-R  
   8.   No. of PCM connected to BTS---OMC-R  
   9.   Version/ Type of BTS---OMC-R  
       All the above report can be analyzed by generating BO report  

       The following step should be taken for improvement of GPRS speed in 2G:  

   1)   Sig = CONC instead of MPLEX16 (using rxmoc command)  
  2)   TN7BCCH= EGPRS  (using rlbdc command)  
   3)   Try to define edge bpc on Chgr=0 (on Non Hopped channel, numreqegprsbpc value should  
       be at least 4 for 4-4-4 site, 6 for 6-6-6 sites.3 for 2-2-2 sites per sector. If there is shortage of  
       BPC in CHGR-0 then we can also define edge bpc in CHGR=1. (Use RLBDC )  
  4)  FPDCH=Number   of   fixed   Edge   channel.   Dedicated   mode   is   to   be   implemented   for  
       guaranteed  data  service  where  Voice  Traffic  is  more  otherwise  all  Timeslots  may  be  in  
       dynamic mode. Also Semi-dedicated channel can be introduced. In dedicated mode maximum  
       recommended value is 2 or 1. If it is set to higher value then voice traffic may be effected.  
       (Use RLGSC command)   
   5)   CHCSDL =CS4     (using RLGSCcommand)  
   6)   Streamsup=yes, epdchbr=32   (using RLGQC command)  
   7)  Number of data user more, then increase the PRACHBLK=4  (using rlpdc command)    
   8)  Abis allocation should be flexible (rxmoc:mo=rxotg-xx, abisalloc= flexilble;)  
   9)   To  check  no.  of  64k  device  in  Abis  path  (rxapi:  mo=rxotg-xx,  dcp=xx,  device=RBLT-xx,    
       res64k)           

       The following activities in Ericsson BSC required for increasing the 2G data speed--  

   1.   Check how many RPP cards are equipped. 1 RPP card= 64 data Time Slot. If equipped with 7  
       RPP cards, then total resources are 448 Time slots (7x64=448).  

  2.   All timeslots may be in dynamic mode. Also semi-dedicated channel can be introduced. We  
       need  to ensure more  64K  channel  (At  least  7  64K  channel)  needs  to  be  defined  in  TG for  
       ensuring more use of E-PDCH rather than B-PDCH and also more Number of EDGE BPC  
       defined in a cell.  

                                                     37  
  
﻿3.   Check for  the  configuration  of  100Mbps  data  & no  error on  Gb  over  Ip link from  BSC  to  
     MSC-MPBN router.  

4.   Augmentation 2nd PCM for every BTS dedicatedly for GPRS is recommended where GPRS  
     traffic is high.   

5.   Also RTGPHDEV congestion to be monitored form GSL Device utilization report. GB over  
     Frame Relay should be migrated to GBoIP as it will ensure some more devices towards radio  
     link. If RTGPHDEV congestion is more than 90% RPP card is to be added. If 7 RPP card  
     already  in  use  then  New  RPP  magazine  need  to  be  introduced  to  reduce  RTGPHDEV  
     congestion. (use STDEP:DEV=RTGPHDEV=”dev no” to check RTGPHDEV Congestion )  

     Whether GPRS is enabled in cell or not can be checked by the following command.  

                                            RLGSP: CELL= {cell name} 

                                                                                                                       

     In  Cells  having  UL/OL  concept  implemented,  set  SCALLOC=BOTHOL  (Use  RLGSC).  
     Otherwise GPRS will be available in Under-laid Sub-cell only.  

     How many EGPRS BPC defined in a cell can be checked by the following command.  

                                           RLBDP: CELL= {cell name};  

                                                                                                                       

       

                                                      38

﻿ 4   BSC  

4.1 BSC Function   

     The  BSC  is  connected  to  the  MSC  on  one  side  and  to  the  BTS  on  the  other.  The  BSC  

     performs the Radio Resource (RR) management for the cells under its control. It assigns and  

     release frequencies and timeslots for all MSs in its own area. The BSC performs the inter-cell  

     handover for MSs moving between BTS in its control. It also re-allocates frequencies to the  

     BTSs in its area to meet locally heavy demands during peak hours or on special events. The  

     BSC controls the power transmission of both BSSs and MSs in its area. The minimum power  

     level for a mobile unit is broadcast over the BCCH. The BSC provides the time and frequency  

     synchronization  reference  signals  broadcast  by  its  BTSs.  The  BSC  also  measures  the  time  

     delay  of  received  MS  signals  relative  to  the  BTS  clock.  The  BSC  provides  control  of  the  

     BTSs and manages radio resources and radio parameters. A single BSC can control a large  

     number of BTS.   

     The BSC functions are divided into the following sub-functions:  

    Provision of signalling links to the MSC   

    Signalling control of the BTSs and hence the Mobile Stations   

    Signalling control of the links with the MFS (what is MFS)  

    Switching of traffic between the MSC and the BTSs   

    Routing of traffic between the MFS and the BTSs   

    Provision of O&M facilities.  

     The basic functions of BSC are   

    Telecommunication functions,  

    Transmission functions,  

    O&M functions  

    Telecommunication functions:  

     BTS  are  responsible  to  handle  physical  resources.  Logical  resources  like  Radio  frequency  

     management (GSM & GPRS) and TCH management is done by the BSC. Every half second  

     BTS’s send radio measurements to the BSC. Those measurements are processed by the BSC  

     which is going to take the handover decision in some cases.  

     Management  of  GSM  radio  frequency  is  also  done  by  BSC.  The  frequency  of  various  

     channels like Broadcast and Common control channels, signalling channels are handled  by  

     BSC. Radio measurement processing, In Call Modification handling is done by BSC.  

       

                                                      46  
  
﻿     BSC also handle GSM & GPRS traffic channel resource management like:-  

    Establishes and releases radio resources  

    Queues requests  

     Selects TCH for handovers  

4.2  BSC Hardware  

          Ericsson BSC is build up with AXE 810 architecture. It is more powerful, less space and  
     power dissipating. The hardware components are:  
       
 1.   GEM (Generic Ericsson Magazine)   
 2.   Group Switch GS 890 (distributed, non-blocking)   
 3.   CL 890 (new clock modules)   
 4.   On board RP (RPI)   
 5.   ET 155-1 (one board ET 155)   
 6.    APG – 40  
          An  important  factor  behind  the  AXE  flexibility  is  the  APZ  Control  System  
     Architecture, which is a two-level architecture including both central and distributed  
     control. It is an approach that ensures high reliability and efficient call handling.

﻿CP & RP  
The Central Processor, CP is duplicated, offering high hardware fault tolerance. In the event  
of a fault, the control may be swapped to the other side with a minimum or no impact on the  
traffic handling capability.  
  
The Regional Processors, RPs, are used for routine repetitive processing and for processing  
intensive tasks such as the termination of the lower protocol layers. The most recent regional  
processors are open processing platforms, on which it is possible to run application software  
using  industry-standard  programming  languages  such  as  C  or  C++.  The  use  of  high-level  
languages also presents other opportunities such as substantial Time to Market gains through  
the incorporation of off-the-shelf standard software modules.  
  
RPP  is  targeted  to  support  data  communication  related  telecommunication  applications.  
RPP  offers  a  range  of  open  hardware  interfaces,  a  range  of  software  applications  plus  a  
complete development environment. It work as a PCU (Packet Control Unit)  

The PCU is a node in the GSM network. It is designed to provide an interface between the  
circuit-switched  GSM  network  and  the  packet-switched  GSN  nodes.  These  GSN  nodes  in  
turn provide an interface to public packet-switched networks.  

The hardware consists of 1-7 RPPs and 2 no of EPSs which can be connected together using  
Ethernet i.e. IP. Each RPP can connect to the SGSN (via the Group Switch when FR is used).  
For GB over IP EPS card connects SGSN directly through the BSC internal IP Gateways .  

Each RPP card provides 64 circuits of 64kbps per circuit. If GB over Frame Relay is used  
31circuits will be utilized for 2MB connectivity with SGSN and rest 33 circuits will be used  
for radio access. All the 64 circuits can also be used for radio access if GB over IP is used. In  
GB  over  IP  configuration  the  EPS  card  provide  up  to  100  mbps  bandwidth  with  SGSN  
through IP gateway and work in redundancy mode. In this case all the RPP resource will be  
utilized for radio access.  

Inter Platform Network  
An Ethernet based, 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps, Inter Platform Network, IPN, is ringing in  
an industry standard, high capacity interface into AXE.

     Another  far-reaching  improvement  is  the  GEM,  a  high-capacity,  flexible,  and  scalable  
     magazine (sub-rack) that anticipates future developments. GEM-based nodes will be smaller,  
     dissipate  less  power,  and   have   greater  maximum  capacity.  Their  implementation  will  
     dramatically improve the cost of ownership and cut time-to-customer for AXE.  

       A GEM can house  

•    two  SCB-RPs,  providing  an  Ethernet  switch,  control  function,  maintenance  support,  and  
     power distribution;  
•    two switch boards (XDB), providing a 16 K plane duplicated group switch;  
•    up to 22 device boards with 15 mm spacing, such as ET155, ECP, or TRA;  
•    pairs  of  DLEBs,  providing  multiplexing  functionality  for  DL3  cable  interfaces,  placed  in  
     device slots; and  
•    CL890 clock modules placed in device slots.  
       
     Transcoder  
       
     The  Transcoder/Rate  Adaptation  (TRA)  function  in  BSC/TRC  performs  transcoding  of  
     speech  information  and  rate  adaptation  of  data  information.  It  also  contains  functions  for  
     Discontinuous  Transmission (DTX).  The  capacity  in number  of channels  per  board  for  the  
     different versions of TRA hardware is given below.  
                
             TRA            HW             FR              EFR               HR                AMR                 AMR

            R6B                            24 per device group of any speech codec (n=1..8), 192 in total  
            R6     with    TFO                             124                                 124 (16 per device

     For R5 different codec cannot be mixed on the same board. Each TRA R6/R6B board consists  
     of 8 device groups and each device group can be configured for any of the supported codec.  
     The capacity for TRA R6 differs depending on if the device group is configured to support  
     TFO, in that case a device group can handle 16 channels. Else and for TRA R6B the capacity  
     is 24 channels per device group.  
                
     One  TRA  EM  consists  of  one  TRA  board.  The  TRA  R5  magazine  includes  (up  to)  16  
     TRABs. TRA R6/R6B is housed in a GEM magazine where it can be mixed with other boards  
     depending on the configuration. All TRA hardware versions can be mixed in the same speech  
     codec pool. Presently we are using CSPB R2 board which work on R6B application.   
                

                                                       49  
  
﻿     Note that, when there are several pools, it is normally the case that AMR, EFR or HR capable  
     mobiles also support FR. In this case the traffic can be shared between the pools and thus not  
     all of them need to be dimensioned for the same grade of service. This means that congestion  
     in one pool, for example, the EFR pool, does not necessary imply congestion for a call, as  
     another pool, e.g. the FR pool, can be used instead.  
                
     ET-155  

     The ET155-1 OC-3 is a single board 155 Mb/s, OC-3, Exchange Terminal supporting ANSI  
     standards  for  SONET.  The  ET155-1  OC-3  together  with  the  GEM  concept  of  AXE  offers  
     very  compact  and  scalable  node  solutions  for  cost  efficient  connections  to  the  transport  
     network.  For  the  purposes  of  equipment  and  network  protection,  Automatic  Protection  
     Switching, APS 1+1, can be provided as an option. For Abis link E1 is required which can be  
     extracted by connecting 2Mb MUX (OMS) with ET155-1.   

     OMS  

     OMS is a MUX which convert one TM to 63 E1. It is a separate equipment and not under  
     AXE environment. For the maintenance of OMS its O&M software to be loaded in Laptop  
     and by connecting the Laptop to OMS’s console the Card configuration and E1 configuration  
     can be done. Sometimes, on power recycle, the E1 configuration of OMS gets corrupted. To  
     rectify  this  we  have  to  logging  into  OMS  through  console  and  through  O&M  command  
     reconfiguration can be done.  

     APG 40  

     The  APG40  is  a  platform  for  the  AXE  central  processor  IO  functions  (APIO)  that  were  
     inherited from the IOGs. It is also a platform for billing (for example, FOS) and statistic data  
     collecting  (for  instance,  STS),  storage,  processing  and  output  from  the  AXE  switch.  For  
     example, the APG40 can be a platform for collecting data related to in-service performance  
     from  the  central  processor.  It  can  also  format  that  data  for  distribution  to  an  operations  
     management.  

4.3  BSC Preventive Maintenance  

     Whenever visiting a BSC, check the following points to ensure that everything is in order:

AP  backup  contains  all  configuration  data  of  Adjunct  Processor  including  all  File  system.  
These file system store TTFile, Statistical files etc. This also stores connectivity details of AP  
to CP and AP to OSS, Mediation server etc. Hence, this back is also equaly important and is  
required to restore AP in emergency.  

AP backup is taken from active node/ cluster node. To check the active node use command  
prcstate & hostname. Then from active node give the following command.

5.2.2 Monthly Routines  
     Climate  control  i.e.  air  conditioners  are  functioning  correctly.  There  is  no  leakage  of  air- 

      conditioned air through door, window or waveguide openings.  

     The air inlet / filters to the cabinet are clean.  

     The oil in the Engine Alternator should be checked with the dipstick to ensure sufficient level  

      and also its usefulness.  

     Functioning of all alarms is tested for service worthiness.  

     A printout of all cell data should be made once in every month and check for false/ extra data  

      should be carried out.  

     Weak cell of batteries to be identified and remedial action should be taken.   

        

5.2.3 Quarterly Routines  
      The following should be checked once in a quarter in addition to the regular daily and weekly  

      check-ups:-  

     Check rack filters and replace if necessary.  

     Carry out battery back-up voltage test, to ascertain whether the batteries are holding their full  

      charge.   

     Check the site temperature and humidity,  see O&M handbook supplied by the vendors.   

     Updation of data in the planning tool based on results of Drive Tests during the quarter.   

     Cell  Planning  and  RF  Planning  should  be  reviewed  for  any  possible  error  or  change  in  

      situation due to addition, deletion or change in configuration of NODE B in the network.   

                                                        87  
  
﻿     Any additional NODE B should be put in service only after A/T and special monitoring on  

      Radio Resource Control(RRC) Setup Success Rate  in all cells of the RNC  is necessary so as  

      to be sure that it is not impacting the performance of any other sector/ cell adversely.    

     Temperature monitoring  

     In case of shelter sites – free cooling filter should be cleaned   

     In case of outdoor site – all canopy fans should be in working condition  

        

5.2.4 Half-yearly Routines  
  Power measurementof the NODE B should be done.  

  The waveguides and connectors are fixed propoerly.  

  VSWR  should  be  measured  once  in  six  months  for  every  NODE  B  and  its  value  should  be  

      maintained within the limit (<1.3) for all waveguides.  

  Earth  resistance  should  be  measured  for  all  NODE  B  sites.  The  value  of  earth  resistance  in  

      respect of DC earth, Tower earth and AC earth should be < 0.5 ohm.   

  It should be checked if there is any leakage for A/C as the same increases load on the plant and  

      also power consumption. It also needs to seen that penalty is not being imposed by Electricty  

      Boards on account of power factor, over consumption etc.  

        

5.2.5 Annual Routines  
      Pre-monsoon activity  

     Shelter /canopy leakage  

     VSWR measurement  

     Waveguide termination weather proofing   

     Site cleaning -  inside shelter / canopy & surrounding area   (particularly @ NBSNL sites )   

     Mini link status (Antenna orientation – tighten, receive power check etc.)  

        

      Spare-Parts Routines  

     There   should   be   a   regular   check   to   ensure   the   availability   of   sufficient   spares   and  

      consumables to service the NODE B sites.   

     A  list  of  spares  should  be  available.  A  record  of  spare  equipment  replaced  in  the  field,  

      available at site or sent for repair should be kept.  

     At least one spare NODE B equipment along with radio link should be kept ready in each of  

      the circles to meet out unforeseen developments like festivals, meetings or natural calamities.  

                                                        88  
  
﻿      *Note- Fault in RU21 is the most common. Most of the time due to improper maintenance of  

      AC,  shelter temperature  goes  very  high  resulting  in  more  high  temperature  in  Board.  Also  

      sometimes due to less cleanliness of RU fault appears. Also More Spare RU21 cards should  

      be available with SSA for providing uninterrupted service.   

5.2.6 Logs and Records  
      Log book has to be maintained at each NODE B.  

     Daily Log for all activities at NODE B including the outage.  

     Power & Engine Alternator run log book  

     To maintain spare-part list at each SSA                         

     To maintain complaint register at SSA for network related problems.  

     To  maintain  list  of  sites  which  fail  frequently,  identify  the  root  cause  and  take  corrective  

      action.  

        

5.3  Node B Fault Monitoring, Alert and Rectification Mechanism  
5.3.1  Fault Monitoring  
     Faults are being continuously monitored on 24 X 7 by NOC / OMCR personnels.  

     As and when any fault occurs the Alarm Generates    

        

5.3.2  Fault Alert Mechanism  
     24X7 NOC / OMCR staff escalates the fault to the concerned persons/ field staff.  

     The concerned officer identifies the fault reason like media problem / power supply problem /  

      equipment related problem  

        

5.3.3  Fault Rectification Mechanism

﻿ 6.  RNC (Radio Network Controller)  
        
  6.1   RNC Function  

      The Radio Network Controller (or RNC) is a governing element in the UMTS radio access  
      network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node Bs that are connected to it. The  
      RNC carries out radio resource management, some of the mobility management functions and  
      is  the point where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from the mobile.  The  
      RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through Media Gateway (MGW) and to  
      the Packet Switched Core Network through SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node).

      Interfaces  

        

                                                                                                                
i)    RNC Interfaces  

      The logical connections between the network elements are known as interfaces. The interface  
      between  the  RNC  and  the  Circuit  Switched  Core  Network  (CS-CN)  is  called  Iu-CS  and  
      between the RNC and the Packet Switched Core Network is called  Iu-PS. Other interfaces  
      include Iub (between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same network).  
      Iu  interfaces  carry  user  traffic  (such  as  voice  or  data)  as  well  as  control  information  
      (see Protocols),  and  Iur  interface  is  mainly  needed  for soft  handovers involving  2  RNCs  
      though  not  required  as  the  absence  of  Iur  will  cause  these  handovers  to  become hard  
      handovers.  

                                                         96  
  
﻿ii)  PROTOCOLS  

     Iub, Iu and Iur protocols all carry both user data and signalling (that is, control plane).  

    Signalling     protocol    responsible     for    the   control    of   the   NodeB      by   the    RNC     is  
     called NBAP (Node-B Application Part). NBAP is  subdivided  into  Common  and  Dedicated  
     NBAP      (C-NBAP       and    D-NBAP),       where    Common       NBAP      controls    overall   Node     B  
     functionality and Dedicated NBAP controls separate cells or sectors of the Node B. NBAP is  
     carried  over  Iub.  In  order  for  NBAP  to  handle  common  and  dedicated  procedures,  it  is  
     divided  into:  NodeB  Control  Port  (NCP)  which  handles  common  NBAP  procedures  and  
     Communication Control Port (CCP) which handles dedicated NBAP procedures.  

    Control   plane   protocol   for   the transport   layer is   called    ALCAP   (Access Link Control  
     Application Protocol). Basic functionality of ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto  
     one AAL2 transmission path using channel IDs (CIDs). ALCAP is carried over Iub and Iu-CS  
     interfaces.  

    Signalling  protocol  responsible  for  communication  between  RNC  and  the  core  network  is  
     called RANAP (Radio Access Network Application Part), and is carried over Iu interface.  

    Signalling       protocol       responsible       for     communications           between       RNCs        is  
     called RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part)                    and   is   carried   on    the   Iur  
     interface.  

      RNC also controls the power of a Node-B.

     Why Power Control?  

    All CDMA users occupy the same frequency spectrum at the same time! Frequency and time  
     are not used as discriminators.  

    CDMA operates by using codes to discriminate between users.  

    CDMA interference comes mainly from nearby users  

    Each user is a small voice in a roaring crowd -- but with a uniquely recoverable code.

     problem not solved then check GPB_MODULE LOAD in which IubLink is located.   
     As described above It should be within 62%. If load is more than 62% then      Change the  
      Subrack of Iublink.                 For that use  
       
   Resub  Iub_(Iub no.)  Subrack=ms or es-1 or es-2       as desired.     
       
     But before using  resub we need to  block IubLink. Then use  resub command & then again  
     deblock IubLink.

     Analysis of Alarms  

     We  need  to  check  Critical  alarm  with  highest  priority  and  then  major  alarm  should  be  
     analyzed.  

1.    For most of the s/w (Software) alarms we need to give restart to plugin unit. For eg. if  there  
     is alarm in RAX, TX or RUIF we need to give cold restart to the Boards.   

     For e.g, if there is alarm in rax-slot7 then we need to give restart   

     > acc 000700 restart                     for p5, p6 & p6.1 sw versions (Slot 07)  
     > acc 000700 manualrestart        for p7  sw versions  
       
2.    If there is alarm in Dbcc, Edbch, ESc or HsDbch devices then cold restart should be given to  
     Tx Board.   

     > acc 001100 restart                     for p5, p6 & p6.1 sw versions (Slot 11)  
     > acc 001100 manualrestart        for p7  sw versions  

                                                         121  
  
﻿3.   For alarm related to carrier we need to give cold restart to corresponding RU card.  

     > acl plugin                          (for checking proxy number of aux plugin unit)  

                  Suppose there is alarm in  RbsSubrack=RU1,RbsSlot=2 then  

     > acc “proxy no” restartAuxUnit  

4.    For  gamma link alarm we need to check managed object & then accordingly need to give  
     restart to the board.  

5.    For  Hardware alarms we need to power off the board from PDU and then power on & if  
     alarm remains we need to check physically in node B whether Red LED is glowing or not. If  
     Red LED is glowing then we need to replace the board.  

6.   For  AntennaBranch_FeederCurrentTooHigh  or  low alarms  we  need  to  check  VSWR  in  
     both the feeders of a particular sector. Also we need to keep in mind that the difference in  
     VSWR between two feeders should be very low.  

7.   License related alarms such as Emergency Unlock of Software Licensing generated because  
     of  setting  emergency  mode.  This  should  be  avoided  as  emergency  state  can  be  used  once  
     only.  In  emergency  state  site  will  be  up  for  7  days.  Also  License  Key  File  Fault  alarm  
     generated if license file corrupted or missing. For solving the issue load new license file.  

8.   NbapCommon_Layer3SetupFailure alarm is  a  critical  one.  Alarm comes  due problem  in  
     Iublink between Node B & RNC. Steps given below  

     > st nbap                    (For checking status of Nbap(Node B Application Protocol)  
       
      We need to check iub controlPlaneTransportOption & userPlaneTransportOption at Node B  
     and both should be same as in RNC against the same iublink. If everything is alright then give  
     restart to CBU using  
     > acc 0 manualrestart or restart         as per sw version of node B  
     >For IP sites no need to check nbap-c & nbap-d at RNC end. If Iublink is down then try to  
     ping IpAccessHostGpb(Iub CP) of Node B. To get Iub CP ip of Node B use  
     > get iub_0001   (to know iub controlPlaneTransportOption & userPlaneTransportOption  
     and note down remotecpipaddress1)  
     > acl ip        note down proxy number of ETMFX-board  
     Then use command  
     >  acc “proxy no”ping        if result is‘no answer’then check media & if result is “alive” then  
     login to node B & check alarms  
     Also check sync and  sync related alarms resolving technique described below.  

9.   For  imagroup related alarm in ATM based Node b use  

     > st imagroup                  (for checking status of imagroup & 3 ImaLinks)  

        

                                                     122  
  
﻿     If problem at far end use the same command at RNC for direct site or at sub-hub as per                         
     ATND. This alarm arises normally due to transmission fault.   
       
10.  For ATM based node B & PDH related alarms use  

     > lst  E1         for checking E1  

     > pget E1       for checking error in media if error found E1 should be blocked immediately  
     using  

     >lbl “proxy for faulty E1”         After there is no error in E1 then for deblocking  

     >ldeb“proxy for faulty E1”  

     >lst vc         for checking status of all VC (Virtual Circuits)  

                                                                                                                                     

     VC 32 & 33 used for mub_link(for login  purpose), 36 &  37 for Nbap-c & Nbap-d, 38 for  
     AAL5 , 39 for CS and PS with R99 & 46 for HSDPA.

                                                          123

11.  For sync related alarms 1   we need to use  
        
      > get sync                       at Node B end  

                                                                                                                                                              

                                                                                                                                                              
      For  NTP  Server  Reachability  Fault  alarm  arises  due  to  media  issue  in  Node  B  with  IP  
      connectivity.  

      For System Clock in Holdover Mode alarm we need to check media.  

                                                                     124  
  
﻿For System Clock in Free-running Mode alarm we need to check sync  status & if status is ok  
then give restart to CBU using acc 0 restart or manualrestart.  

If status of either of the parameter nodeIsStable & nodeIsSynchronized is false then also we  
need to give restart to CBU  

Synch  Reference  Not  Reliable  alarm  normally  arises  in  Node  B  with  IP  connectivity.  
Remedy is to check syncRefStatus at RNC end using   

>get synchronization                            (at RNC end)  

                                                                                                                            

Normally  if  there  is  loss  of  tracking  alarm  in  RNC  then  Synch  Reference  Not  Reliable  
alarm arises in Node B.  

For loss of tracking alarm we need to check status of TimDevice using   

> get TimDevice      for checking status of TUB card at RNC .Also phusically it can be seen.  
If.   
green LED of TUB card  blinks then  there should be sync issue. Media   
should be checked properly and clock of transmission system as well as of   
   MGW should be checked .Command can be used in Node B also.  

                                                    125  
  
﻿                                                                                                                                     
       
     Status of timing device should be as above print. If standbyStatus is Cold_Standby then also  
     check clock of transmission system as well as of MGW should be checked.   
       
12. For  MTP3b Link  Out of Service alarm  we need to check atmport status of slot-6  & 7. If  
     down then we need to check media step by step upto core network.  
13. For  NodeSynch_Phase_Difference_Threshold  to  high  we  need  to  check  power  level  of  
     media Tx & Rx at RNC and also at Node B end. Power level should be between -12 to -18  
     dbm for optimal performance.  

       

     Alarm log and event log  

     > lga     (for checking alarm log)  
       
     Alarm log needs to checked on daily basis. For checking alarm log use command  

     >lga –s yyyymmtttt      time should be in 24 Hr format and also in GMT  

     for taking help use h lga  

     Kindly  analyze  alarm  log  sincerely.  When  the  alarm  was  generated  and  when  seized.  
     Wheather Alarm is generating frequently also needs to be checked.   

    commonly MTP3b Link Out of Service alarm needs to be checked.   
    Another              alarms             CcDevice_DeviceDisabled,                        DcDevice_DeviceDisabled,  
     PacketDataRouter_CnNotRespondingToICMPEchoSpDevicePool=PdrDevice,PdrDevic 
     e=4,PacketDataRouter=pg22a  (communication_protocol_error).  All  these  these  alarms  
     generate in RNC because of media issue. But if media is ok then ET-MF4 boards in slot 6 & 7  
     as well SPB21 boards from slot 19 to 23 needs to checked.   

     > lge      ( for checking event log)  
       

                                                          126  
  
﻿                                                                                                                           
PIU restarted issue normally arises due to fault in board.   

Action to be taken is to lock the board using  

>lbl ‘proxy number of plugin unit’    plugin unit can be found using acl plugin   

Then give manualrestart to plugin unit   

>acc “proxy no”manualrestart  

Then observe for few days.If event again observed in event log then first lock the board, pull  
out  board  from  slot  and  wait for  some  time  and  reinsert  the  board  again.  If  event  is again  
repeating then replace the board.  

For     NssSynchronization_SynchRefChanged                    &     NssSynchronization_SystemClockStatus  
Changed  events TUB board and needs to be checked.   

Action to be taken is to lock the board using  

>lbl ‘proxy number of plugin unit’        ( plugin unit can be found using acl plugin )  

Then give manualrestart to plugin unit   

>acc “proxy no”manualrestart  

Then observe for few days. if event observed in event log then first lock the board, pull out  
board from slot and wait for some time and reinsert the board again. If not solved then error  
in media should be checked properly as well as clocks of ETR media and MGW should be  
checked. If PIU restarted event is observed in slot 6 ET-MF4 in subrack=MS then card should  
tested with the above mentioned procedure. For remotely located RNC form MGW this kind  
issue appears more frequently.

      We need to check how many RABs are failed due to DlChnlcode, DLconnlimit, Dlpwr. If  
     RABS  are failed to code, connection limit & power then we need to analyze  the particular  
     cell. For that at first we need to find IubLink of that cells where there is RAB failure is more.  
     Then use command  

     >cedr –r Iub_00051 (For checking power consumption, dlCode used, HS count, ASE uses,  
     SF uses. Live condition of cells can be observed)  

                                                                                                                                     
    For  code  related  issue  check  dlCode  from  above  command.  If  it  is  too  high  then  check  
     parameter DlcodeAdm.  

     >get usp0051 DlcodeAdm      (by default it should be 80. If RAB failure is high make it 85)  

       Again  use  cedr  command.  If  dlCode  is  observed  to  be  high  again  then  check  parameter  
     numHsPdschCodes in HsDsch for that cell. Procedure to check numHsPdschCodes already  
     described above. Reduce the value in stpes of 1 & monitor RRC failure and RAB breakdown.  
     If  RRC  failure  is  more  than  2%  value  then  reduce.  Then  again  reduce  the  value.  But  we  
     should try to keep   

                                                          133  
  
﻿     NumHsPdschCodes value atleast  7 asThreshold for determiningRLC PDU size 656 bits are  
     used  if  codeThresholdPdu656  <  numHsPdschCodes    (For  category  7  to  10  UE),  otherwise  
        -  336  bits  are  used  if  codeThresholdPdu656  >=  numHsPdschCodes.  If  issue  still  persists  
     then reduce the value to in steps of 1 again till issue is resolved.  

    If RAB is failed due to connection limit then SF (Spreading Factor) needs to be checked  
       
    For power issues we need to check for ulint(Uplink Interference)  

     >get utrancell=usp002 maximumTransmissionPower                 (default value 430)  

     > get utrancell=usp002 primaryCpichPower                                   (default vale 300)  

     If  power  congestion  is  high,  pwrAdm  value  can  be  set  to  80.  If  again  high  RAB  failure  
     observed        and      power        consumption          is    high(using             cedr      –r)     then      parameters   
     maximumTransmissionPower                        &    primaryCpichPower                 can    be    set    to   400     &     270  
     consecutively.   

     If issue is not resolved yet then antenna till is to be checked to it down tilted. It will reduce  
     both power and code congestion.

     up can be  also be seen)

﻿     *For  Speed  related  issues  of  a  Particular  Node  B  Above  Node  B  parameters  needs  to  be  
     checked. Then check whether all E1(for ATM based Node B) are working and if it is a IP site  
     then  how  many  E1  are  configured  for  IP  sites  with  FE  connectivity.  Sometimes  FE  
     connectivity  given  using  minilink.  Then  check  how  many  E1  are  working  by  logging  into  
     minilink. Physical indications of Converter used for IP connectivity can mislead.   

       

     Use UER & CEDR commands for checking load in that particular Node B.  

    Recommendations for IUB Bandwidth for IP sites   

     For heavily loaded sites use GE Connectivity if feasible          

     16 E1 for Urban Areas with FE connectivity  

     16 E1 for Sub-urban Areas with FE Connectivity  

      8 E1 for Rural Areas having Average Traffic  

      If Feasibility of 8 E1 is not available then maximum available bandwidth should be given for  
     IubLink of   a Node B  

     *For  Speed  related  Issues  in  all  Node  Bs  of  a  RNC  check  all  the  parameters  of  RNC as  
     discussed above and the check the Media upto SGSN. Also check latency. Check IU-PS link  
     status,  PDR  &  whether  ATMPORTs  connected  for  data  are  up  or  not.  Check  whether  
     AtmTrafficDescriptor of VCs of ATMPort for Iu-PS link. All VCs should be latched with  
     AtmTrafficDescriptorid U4. Use command  

     > lst pdr

     Now copy the highlighted link (any link reserved by transport network can be copied)  

                                                        137

Now copy the link against vclTpId   

                                                                                                                            
If AtmTrafficDescriptor  is not equal to U4 then make it U4. Use Command  

>set         ‘proxy          no        from          above          command’             atmTrafficDescriptorId  
AtmTrafficDescriptor=U4  

                                                                                                                            
AtmTrafficDescriptor  is    to  be  checked  between  each  cross  connection  of  VC.  Between  
RNC & MGW and between MGW & SGSN. i.e. upto SGSN AtmTrafficDescriptor  is to be  
checked.  

If all the above points are checked then after connecting a session and by pinging DNS server,  
latency issue can be checked   

For e.g. ping 8.8.8.8   (DNS server of Google)  

Ideally  time should  be less  than  100  ms,  If  it is  more than  500 ms  & packet loss  received  
during ping then Kindly check Gn & Gp interface.   

*For  Coverage  related issues  at  first  check whether  sector  is  up  or not.  If up  then check  
whether customers latching or not using CEDR & UER.  

 i) If customer are latching then check uplink interference. It should not be more than -100  
dbm. If Uplink Interference too high then antenna should be down tilted to minimize load &  
decrease  coverage.  Also  CPICH  &  Maximum  Transmission  Power  can  be  reduced  as  
explained above.  

 ii)  If  no  customer  is  latching  then  check  how  many  RRC  connection  requested  for  the  
previous day and RRC success rate of a particular cell. If  RRC connection request is very  

                                                   138  
  
﻿       less then swap RU from working sector of the same Node B. If problem Persists and no alarm  
       appears in the Node B then Antenna may be faulty.  

       *Note- Higher Software version at Node B & RNC is recommended (for e.g. P7) as it will  
       give better performance of Rake Receiver.   

       *Some  Important  Features  to  be  implemented  in  BSNL  for  better  performance  of

       ii)  Support of 16 HSPA (HSDPA+EUL) users in each cell  

       iii) Introduction of 2ms TTI  

       For   implementation   above   mentioned   features   new   licences   with   all   the   above  
       mentioned capacity & features to be provided in all Node Bs & RNCs.

﻿8.  Drive Test  
8.1 The Purpose of Drive Test  

     Drive  testing  is principally  applied  in both the  planning  and  optimization  stage of  network  

     development. However, there are other purposes for which drive testing can be used:  

    To verify the network physical/system parameters, as defined in the Network  

    To measure any interference such as overshooting from neighbouring sites.  

    To locate any RF issues relating to traffic problems such as dropped or blocked calls.  

    To locate any poor coverage areas.  

    To  verify  the  performance  of  the  network  after  changes have  been  made  e.g.  When a  new  

     TRX is added; the removal or addition of a new site; any power adjustments or changes to the  

     antenna; any changes in clutter or traffic habits such as the addition of new roads etc.  

    To monitor the performance of a competitor’s network (Benchmark Drive).  

8.2  When to Drive Test  

    Drive testing can take place during the day or at night and is dependent upon the operator’s  

     requirements and subscriber habits.  

    Drive testing during the day will mimic the conditions as seen by subscribers, but may clog  

     up the network if call analysis is being performed.  

    Drive testing during the night will allow a greater area to be surveyed due to the reduction in  

     vehicular congestion. It will also allow for certain test  signals to be transmitted and tested,  

     particularly  when  setting  up  a  new  site,  without  interrupting  normal  operation.  However,  

     night-time testing does not mimic the conditions experienced by subscribers.  

    For  planning  purposes,  drive  testing  is  typically  performed  at  night  and  for  maintenance  

     purposes, drive testing is performed during the day.  

8.3  Where to Undertake Drive Test  

    Some areas of a network will have greater performance problems than others. Drive Testing  

     should not be uniform throughout the whole network, but should be weighted towards areas  

     where there are significant RF problems.  

    There  may  be  other  areas  of  the  network  that  require  temporary  coverage  during  a  certain  

     time of the year e.g. an exhibition centre or a sports stadium. These areas should be examined  

     and planned in greater detail.  

    It is important that a drive test is documented. This is specified by the Operator and can either  

     take the form of creating a new item of documentation or filling in an existing document. All  

                                                     140  
  
﻿       documentation will be passed to Analysts and Engineers, who will need accurate records of  

       any test work carried out.  

         

  8.4 Route Plans  

       The area to be drive tested is ascertained before leaving the office. There are three levels of  

       drive testing depending on the purpose of the test:  

i)     Primary Route: This includes all major roads, highways and should be given priority to all  

       other  roads  when  conducting  a  coverage  test,  unless  a  new  site  is  put  into  service  for  a  

       specific objective.  

   ii)  Secondary Route: This includes all streets, by-streets and compounds, where accessible, such  

       as  a  University  Campus.  Secondary  routes  are  used  in  areas  where  problems  have  been  

       located during a primary route test and further investigation is needed.  

   iii)  Miscellaneous  Routes:  This  includes  in-building  and  non-access  routes  to  vehicles  such  as  

       shopping malls, golf courses, airports, hotels, etc.  

  8.5  Drive Test tools  

       Drive Test tools is an air interface test tool for real-time diagnostics. It lets you monitor voice  
       channels as well as data transfer over GPRS/ EDGE. It now supports in-building positioning  
       of network data. It also measures radio parameters, assesses speech quality, and decodes air  
       interface messages efficiently and easily. It is powerful troubleshooting tool for RF engineers  
       and other personnel working with network performance improvement. The data is presented  
       in real time along with information on cell sites and channels, and can be saved for later use.  

       KPI (Key Performance Indicators)  

       KPI are a set of industry-standard statistics describing network performance. Drive test tool  
       provides KPIs for GPRS, including GPRS mean data and GPRS attach setup time. Measuring  
       KPIs allows impartial comparison of different networks.  

       2G Voice KPI –   

      Drop call rate  
      Block call rate  
      Call Setup Success Rate(CSSR)  
      Handover Success Rate(HSR)  
      RX quality

    Average throughput (Kbps)  
    Latency  
    Session Disconnection Rate (Drop rate)  
    Successful Data transmission D/L attempts  
    Successful Data transmission U/L attempts  
       
8.6  Data Measurements  

     Data  service  performance  measurements  can  be  performed  on  the  air  interface  layers  
     (RLC/MAC/LLC)  for  GPRS.  Typical  services  that  can  be  used  for  data  testing  are  e-mail,  
     HTTP,  FTP  and  Ping.  Measurements  can  be  utilized  from  the  command  sequence  tool  in  
     order  to  automate  repeated  procedures.  A  number  of  measurements  and  events,  such  as  
     throughput, retransmissions, and C/I per timeslot can be displayed on the map, in line charts,  
     or in status monitors. Some of the available GPRS information include:-  

    RLC/LLC Throughput Downlink/Uplink(Kpbs)  
    RLC/LLC BLER Downlink/Uplink (%)  
    Number of used time slots and coding schemes  
    PDP context BLER  
    TBF events  
    PDCH Utilization  

     C/I Measurements  

     C/I is the ratio between the signal strength of the current serving cell and the signal strength  
     of interfering components. C/I is measured in real time in both idle mode and dedicated mode  
     (also  in  frequency  hopping  networks).  The  C/I  parameter  enables  the  identification  of  
     frequencies exposed to particularly high levels of interference.  

     Channel Verification tool  

     The  Channel  Verification  tool  allows  the  user  to  check  the  availability  of  a  set  of  traffic  
     channels (FR and EFR), typically those used in a cell or site. Each timeslot can be verified  
     separately. It is also possible to verify sites using hopping frequencies (regardless of baseband  
     and synthesized hopping).  

     Status presentation  

     To help users monitor the status of the network, special presentation views have been created.  
     These predefined views include information such as:  

    Serving cell and neighbouring cells (up to 6)  
    Current traffic channel  
    Radio environment parameters  
    Decoded Layer 2 and Layer 3 messages

﻿Events  

Events such as handovers, dropped calls and blocked calls are indicated by symbols and audio  
signals. Users can also define events of their own.  

User Interface  

The collected data is presented on a map, in line charts, and in test format windows, all of  
which are synchronized. Events  and sir interface messages  are listed separately and can  be  
inspected  in  detail.  Decoded  Layer  3  messages  can  be  filtered  to  facilitate  spotting  the  
important messages during analysis. The utilization of so called parallel coordinates makes it  
much  easier  to  discern  important  relationships  between  different  parameters.  The  user  
interface can be freely configured, and users can build their own presentation windows. The  
easy set-up leaves more time for collecting data.

﻿  C1 measurement  
     C1  is  the  path  loss  criterion,  which  is  used  to  estimate  the  balance  between  uplink  and  
     downlink  
     • Mobile camps on to a cell where C1 is the maximum  
     • Mobile in idle mode will at regular intervals carry out C1 measurements for both serving  
     cell and Top 6 neighbour cells.  
     • Mobile will do a cell reselection to a neighbour whose C1 exceeds the C1 of the server  
     • Mobile will provided addition hysteresis value to be added to the C1 of the server when the  
     neighbour is in different LAC  
       
  C1 Calculations  
     C1  =  A  - max  ( B,0 )  
     A = Average Received signal Level - Min Receive Level  
     B = Access Power - Max power of Mobile ( Classmark )  
     A = +  = Good Downlink Path  
     B = -- = Good Uplink Path  
     ---For  Cell selection  C1 > 0  
     ---For Cell Reselection C1 of new cell > C1 of current cell  
     or C1 falls below 0, both for a period of 5 seconds.  
       
  C2 Measurements  
       
     CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET : ( 0 - 126 dB // 2 dB steps )  
     Positive or a negative offsets applied to cells permanently over C1  
     Used for prioritazation  in cell reselection ( ex: umbrella cells)  
     TEMPORARY_OFFSET : ( 0 - 60 dB // 10 dB steps)  
     Negative offset applied to a neighbor cell whose C1 exceeds C1 of server  
     Offset remains valid for a timer duration  
     Used for optimizing frequent cell reselections.  
     PENALTY_TIME : ( 20s to 620s // 20secs steps)  
     The duration for which the Temporary_Offset is applied.  
     •C2 measurements are optionally used to optimize and prioritize cell reselections.  
     •Additional  parameters  are  broadcasted  to  the  Mobile,  which  are  implemented  over  C1  
     calculations.

     Rxlev  
     • During reception of burst for serving cell  
     • Minimum one neighbor cell measured in 1 frame  
       
     RxQual  
     • BER measurements carried over 26 bits of midamble  
     • Ranges between 0 - 7 ( 0 indicates no errors )  
       
     Full and Sub  
     Rxlev_Full&RxQual_Full : Measurements taken over full set of TDMA frames  
                                                     Full set of TDMA frames : 102 for SDCCH  
                                                     Full set of TDMA frames : 104 TCH  
       
     Rxlev_Sub&RxQual_Sub: Measurements taken over subset of TDMA frames  
     If even one frame is not transmitted in the measurement period, then it is considered as subset  
     of TDMA frames  
  When do we practically consider sub?  
       
•    When DTX used, and the receiver enters the DTX mode, then the measurement done over all  
     the frames is not valid.   
•    With DTX, if there is completely no speech for 480ms, then still there will be 8 frames of SID  
     and 4 frames of SACCH, these 12 subset frames will be used for sub measurements.  
•    DTX is not used on BCCH carrier (all timeslots), hence if the call is on a TCH timeslot which  
     is on a BCH carrier, then it will always be FULL, and in the measurement report both Sub  
     and Full values will be same.  

                                                         148  
  
﻿•    DTX is not used on the SDCCH also, hence the above clause applies to this also.  
•    On  a  TCH  carrier,  when  DTX  was  used  by  the  BTS  in  the  previous  480ms  period,         
     measurement is Sub, else it is full.  
•    If  Frequency  Hopping  was  used,  and  BCH  carrier  was  a  part  of  it,  and  downlink    power  
     control is used, then the Rxlev measurements will always be sub ( since BCH carrier frames  
     are not included in the Rxlev measurement averaging), but RxQual will be full.  
       

                                                                                                                                 

  Radio Link Counter  
     Under what conditions will this decrement   
     -- Poor RF link (Rxlev and RxQual)  
     -- Interference  
     -- Uplink Problems!!!!   
       
  Frame Erasure Rate (FER)  
     3 bits CRC is added to the dedicated channels and on Type 1a bits of speech, in the coding  
     process  
     • If the CRC detection at the Mobile is invalid, it indicates a Bad frame and FER counter goes  
     up.  
     • The effect perceived by the user is a “Ping-Pong” sound.  
     • FER is very useful to estimate quality under frequency hopping conditions, when Rxqual is  
     bursty.  
     •  Under Frequency  Hopping condition, Rxqual does  not  resemble a true  picture  of  quality,  
     FER is the preferred parameter.  
     • Since only 3 bits are used for CRC, the probability of detecting bad frames is only 12.5%  
     • How do we measure FER %?  
     • % of speech frames erased over last 4 measurement periods

     Overall: Done over a wide geography  
     Selected: Done over a selected problem area  
       
    For overall , drive test is done over a large area for verification  
    For selected, drive test is done over the selected area, where optimization work was done, but  
     the problems (specific to frequency related) gets shifted to other areas. So it should be taken  
     care specially.  
    Pre Optimization Drive test data is generally derived from QA Drive test itself  
    Post Optimization Drive test can also be undertaken by QA team in a selected zone.

     NCS - NEIGHBOURING CELL SUPPORT  
       
     NCS  can  be  used  for  finding  missing  neighbouring  cell  relations.  If  there  are  missing  
     neighbouring cell relations, the result will be more dropped calls and bad quality for the end- 
     users, since they will be connected to the wrong cells in some areas.  
       
     Also   NCS   can   be   used   for   finding   unnecessary   neighbouring   cell   relations.   Having  
     unnecessary neighbours in the BA-list makes the measurements less accurate.  
       
     If you compare the problem of having too long BA-lists with the problem of missing cells as  
     defined neighbours the problem for the end-user with long BA-lists is several magnitudes less  
     than the problems which can occur if a cell that should be defined as a neighbour is not. As a  
     thumb rule about 16-20 frequencies in the Active BA-list are recommended, but some cells  
     require more than that since they cover a large area and need to have handover relations to  
     many other cells.  
       
     NCS can also be used to find neighbours to a new cell.  
  
    To find missing neighbour cell relations  
    To find unnecessary neighbour cell relations  
    To find neighbour cell relations to new cells  
    Cells with swapped sectors  
    Cell in the wrong position  
    Cells with wrong antenna direction  
    Areas with no dominant server  
    Allows fast re-configuration during catastrophy situations

     FAS – FREQUENCY ALLOCATION SUPPORT  

     FAS is a tool intended to support frequency optimization in order to minimize interference in  
     the radio network.  

     The  interference  level  in  GSM  networks  has  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum  in  order  to  use  the  
     frequency  spectrum  in  an  efficient  way,  and  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  network.  The  
     speech quality and the amount of dropped calls are directly affected by the interference level.  

     FAS  is  an  optional  feature  and  aims  at  relieving  the  user  from  the  burden  of  frequency  
     optimization. By monitoring the up and downlink interference environment in the network.  
     FAS  can  find  bad  frequency  allocations,  both  for  BCCH  (Broadcast  Control  Channel)  and  
     TCH (Traffic Channel) carriers and replace them with better ones.  

     The user can order FAS to perform recordings on up to, but not more than, 150 frequencies in  
     at least 2000 cells handled by one OSS (Operations Support System). After the recording is  
     completed, the result values are reported and in geographical maps.  

    to find  better frequency allocations in the cells (network optimization)  
    to help introducing a new  in the network (cell planning)  
    to monitor the interference levels on frequencies in use (network supervision)

﻿FAS Uplink Intereference  
The uplink measurements are made by all TRXs in all cells that are included in the recording.  
A sample of the uplink interference is collected at least every 15th second on every frequency  

that was chosen before the start of the recording. The result that is collected by FAS at the end  
of the recording consists of  three values for every frequency in every cell.  
FAS Dowlink Interference  
The downlink measurements are based on measurements made by the MSs.The information  
that is included in the measurement report for the six surrounding cells are : Signal strength,  
BCCH  frequency  and  BSIC.  The  last  two  are  used  to  identify  which  cell  that  has  been  
measured. FAS is able to modify the BA-list so that frequencies normally not included in the  
BA-list can be measured on (test-frequencies).  
For every measurement report the signal strength of the reported cells are compared with the  
signal strength of the serving cell, to see if there is any potential interference between the cells.

﻿    RNO has some additional members i.e., FOX, NOX, TET and SYROX  

    FOX – Frequency Optimization Expert  

    FOX always record on both uplink and downlink. But instead of just showing the results (like  
    FAS),  FOX  has  the  additional  functionality  of  proposing  changes  that  will  improve  the  
    network quality. This is done with an algorithm that takes all possible frequencies in all cells  
    into account, and suggests the best changes for the cells included in the recording.  

    NOX – Neighbouring Cell List Optimization Expert  

    NOX does the analysis of neighbours to add and remove for all cells in the recording.  

   Gives recommendation on neighbours to add and remove  
   Possibility to accept or reject some or all of the recommendations  

    TET – Traffic Estimation Tool  

    TET is used to estimate how much traffic a new cell will catch and to quantify the off-load  
    and remaining traffic in the surrounding cells.  

    SYROX - Synchronized Radio Network Optimization Expert  

    SYROX is a tool included in the RNO product family.  

    The  purpose  of  SYROX  is  to  provide  an  easy  and  efficient  way  of  optimizing  frequency  
    hopping  parameters.  The  goal  is  to  avoid  interference  and  to  distribute  the  remaining  
    interference evenly all over the channels.

13.3.2                 Alarm Log   
         
         
       The  alarm  log  gives  access  to  the  alarm  notifications  that  have  been  collected  from  the  

       terminals.  An  operator  can  read,  filter,  sort  and  save  the  log  files  for  analysis  and  problem  

       tracking.  Log  records  can be moved  automatically  to  an archive, to  keep the  database  from  

       growing too large. The Alarm Log window can show data for one selected terminal or for all  

       terminals.   It  contains  two  fields  of  information:  a  list  of  logged  alarms  and  detailed  

       information for the selected log. The list of logged alarms includes date, time and severity and  

       why the log was performed. It also shows identity and terminal type for the logged equipment.

﻿10.  Customer is facing no coverage problem, however in the recent past he was getting  
     good signal at the same place.  

     A – Check the Azimuth and Tilt of antenna,any H/W fault or VSWR.  

11.  Sometimes  when  the  customer  is  surfing  data,  he  is  not  able  to  get  voice  call  from  
     other person ?(Not reachable annocement )  

     A – A s/w patch should be loaded in BSC.so that Data session will be halted and voice call  

     will be  connected.  

12.  The traffic of the sector is drastically reduced, however all other KPIs of the sector  
     are ok?  

     A - Check the Azimuth and Tilt of antenna,any H/W fault or VSWR.  

13.  Customer can make calls but cannot surf the data (2G)  

     A - Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook       

     Cell is GPRS enabled or phone APN setting.                                               (Page 37,38)  

14.  Customer is getting good signal but no getting incoming call (The calling party gets  
     Out of Coverage’  anouncement.  

     A – Check the Paging Discarded of cell, PCH cogestion or big LAC area  

15.  Customer is facing poor data speed in 3G.  

     A -  Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook QoS -3G                                           (Page 137,138)

     A – Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M HandbookRNC Health Checkup  (Page 106)  

17.  Customer can surf the data but cannot make calls in 3G  

     A - Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook RNC Health Checkup       (Page 106)  

18.  Customer is having problem of signal fluctuation in 3G.  

     A - If customer is using 3G in the Edge of a cell Boundary or If Node B is not stable in that  

     place then also this may happen. Kindly trace customer and check alarms of that particular  

     node B.  

19.  The  mobile  is  not  seamlessly  latching  between  2G  and  3G  even  if  both  signals  are  
     good.  

                                                     201  
  
﻿      A  –  If  mobile  is  not  latching  to  2G,  there  may  be  due  to  heavy  congestion  in  RTGPH  

      Devide group or SDCCH congestion & If mobile is not latching to 3G, there may be heavy  

      RRC congestion.                

      Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook                                                               (Page 133,134,135)  

20.  The customer is not able to surf the data in 3G even if there is “H” symbol on screen.  

      A – This is may be due to very poor bandwidth in Iublink or error in Iu-PS link/Iu-PS link  

      is not stable or there is heavy congestion(power congestion & code Congestion).     

      Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook                                                                            (Page 134)  

21.  The  customer  is  facing  low  data  speed  as  well  as  frequent  interruptions  while   
      surfing.  

      A -  For low data speed Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook  

      QoS of Radio Network -3G                                                                           (Page137,138&139)         

      Frequent  interruptions  may  be  due  to  very  low  bandwith  &  high  load.  Also  power  

      congestion & Code Congestion is to be checked.                                                                                    

      Refer to Ericsson RAN O & M Handbook                                                                            (Page 134)  

22.  Doesn't switch from 2G to 3G & vice versa?  

 A-  If UE is not switching from 2G to 3G then check reference clock status. Use   

                      NSSTP;    & NSDAP;   (wd & fd value should be zero)  
      Check network synchronization data                                                                        
      Also use RLSUP & RLUMP command  
             

      If UE is not switching from 3G to 2G then check whether GSM relation is defined or not.  

          
      Use following commands for creating GSM relation  
        
        

                
        
        

                                                               202  
  
﻿23.  A  group  of  newly  defined  Node  B  in  same  RNC  are  facing  problem  in  data.  The  
      media is ok.  

     A –  This problem may be due to New Routing Area Definition for the Node Bs at RNC  

      end but same routing area is not created at SGSN.                                                               

24.   What are the advantages of TMA?  
 A-  TMA  reduces  system  noise,  improves  uplink  sensitivity  and  leads  to  longer  UE  battery  
      life.   
       
25.  What is Eb/No?  

      By  definition  Eb/No  is  energy  bit  over  noise  density,  i.e.  is  the  ratio  of  the  energy  per  
      information bit to the power spectral density (of interference and noise) after dispreading.  

      Eb/No = Processing Gain + SIR  

26.  What is Ec/Io?  

      Ec/Io  is  the  ratio  of  the  energy  per  chip  in  CPICH  to  the  total  received  power  density  
      (including CPICH itself).  

27.   Sometimes we say Ec/Io and sometimes we say Ec/No, are they different?  

      Io = own cell interference + surrounding cell interference + noise density  

     No = surrounding cell interference + noise density  

      That is, Io is the total received power density including CPICH of its own cell, No is the  
     total received power density excluding CPICH of its own cell.  Technically Ec/Io should  
     be the correct measurement but, due to equipment capability, Ec/No is actually measured.   
      In UMTS, Ec/No and Ec/Io are often used interchangeably.  

28.   What is RSCP?  

      RSCP stands for Received Signal Code Power – the energy per chip in CPICH averaged  
      over 512 chips.  

29.   What is SIR?  

      SIR  is  the  Signal-to-Interference  Ratio  –  the  ratio  of  the  energy  in  dedicated  physical  
      control channel bits to the power density of interference and noise after dispreading.  

30.  What is “pilot pollution”?  

      Simply  speaking,  when  the  number  of  strong  cells  exceeds  the  active  set  size,  there  is  
      “pilot pollution” in the area.  Typically the active set size is 3, so if there are more than 3  
      strong cells then there is pilot pollution.  

      Definition of “strong cell”: pilots within the handover window size from the strongest cell.   
      Typical handover window size is between 4 to 6dB.  For example, if there are more than 2  
      cells  (besides  the  strongest  cell)  within  4dB  of  the  strongest  cell  then  there  is  pilot  
     pollution.

﻿31.  Briefly describe the UE to UTRAN protocol stack (air interface layers).  

 The radio interface is divided into 3 layers:  

 Physical  layer  (Layer  1,  L1):  used  to  transmit  data  over  the  air,  responsible  for  channel  
      coding, interleaving, repetition, modulation, power control, macro-diversity combining.  

 Link layer (L2): is split into 2 sub-layers – Medium Access Control (MAC) and Radio Link  
      Control (RLC).  
    MAC: responsible for multiplexing data from multiple applications onto physical channels  
      in preparation for over-the-air transmission.  

    RLC: segments the data streams into frames that are small enough to be transmitted over  
      the radio link.  

 Upper layer  (L3):  vertically  partitioned into  2 planes: control  plane for signalling and user  
      plan for bearer traffic.  
     RRC (Radio Resource Control) is the control plan protocol: controls the radio resources  
      for the access network.  

      In implementation:  

 1.   UE has all 3 layers.  
 2.   Node B has Physical Layer.  
 3.   RNC had MAC layer and RRC layer  

  

32.  What are the possible causes for a Drop Call on a UMTS network?  

 Poor Coverage (DL / UL)  
 Pilot Pollution / Pilot Spill over  
 Missing Neighbour  
 SC Collisions  
 Delayed Handovers  
 No resource availability (Congestion) for Hand in  
 Loss of Synchronization  
 Fast Fading  
 Delayed IRAT Triggers  
 Hardware Issues  
 External Interference  
   

33.  What is RTWP? What is the significance of it?  

   
      RTWP   means   Received   Total  Wide-band   Power.  It  gives  the  Total  Uplink   Power  
      (Interference) level received at NodeB                                                           (Page       130) 
                             

34.  How to reduce the card failure rate ?  

      A -   It is observed that the main reasons for card failure are – Temperature, frequent power  

      failure and dust  

                                                          204  
  
﻿(1) Temperature  of  the  equipment  should  be  monitored  through  alarms  from  OMCR  and  if  

     high temperature is observed, corrective action should be immediately taken to restore the  

     temperature to normal level.  

(2) Frequently AC supply failure should be immediately attended.   

    The stabilizing transformer may be introduced.   

    Battery back up should be proper  

    Engine Alternator should be in working condition.  

(3) Measures should be taken to prevent / remove dust from equipment.  

    As a part of prevention, There should be no opening in the shelter so that entry of dust can  

     be restricted.   

    As a part of dust removal, regular cleaning should be ensured.  

(4) Equipement should be properly earthed and the earth resistance should be < 1 ohm.  

     Some innovations , resulting in value addition to overall experience  

1.   TRX Reshuffling:  

     Since the number of TRX available in each circle is constant, it becomes a necessary to  

     deploy TRX in an optimum manner. The TRX in any sector should not be more than the  

     demand of traffic being carried by the sector. So from low traffic sectors, TRX should be  

     removed and those TRX should be deployed to sectors carrying high traffic.  

2.   Rehoming:  

     The Traffic load and paging load of BSCs / RNCs in terms of voice and data should be  

     considered at regular intervals and BTS / Node B sites should be shifted from one BSC /  

     RNC to another one for even distribution of the load. Similarly, BSCs / RNCs should be  

    paranted to MGWs in such a way that traffic load is uniformly distributed among MGWs  

     as well as the inter MGW traffic is minimized.  

     A simple software making a smart phone more useful “G-NetTrack”  

    There are many mobile network monitors available freely on the Internetwork which can  

     be installed in smart mobile handset. One of the good app is G-NetTrack.  

    G-NetTrack is a GSM / UMTS network monitor.  

       

    Features:

16.  Data Backup Procedure for different nodes:  
       
     The Exchange Data of BSC / MSC / MPBN are vital and it should be backed up in external  
     media in a routine manner . Three number of external disk / Tape should be usd for taking  
     any backup and same exchane data should be kept in such external media in three different  
     day as per the planned frequency. Mainly there are three type of Backup.  
       
16.1 CP backup:  
     The CP Backup should be taken in external disk/ tape once in in a week. The same media  
     may be repeated after three week show that at any time we have three backup of different  
     date.  
       
16.2 APG Backup:  
     APG backup should be taken once in a by week. Three different media should be used and  
     repeated after the designated frequency.  
       
16.3 MPBN Router / Switch Backup:  
     The MPBN Router and Switch configuration data should be backed up in external media /  
     computer / Laptop once in a week. We should store data of three conswquetive week after  
     which it may be overwritten.  
       
16.4 Backup Tracker:  
     The backup media details should be recorded in a specified format called Backup Tracker.  
     It will record the date of backup with media identity and the name / signature of technical  
     person who has taken the backup. The sample tracker format is given below.
